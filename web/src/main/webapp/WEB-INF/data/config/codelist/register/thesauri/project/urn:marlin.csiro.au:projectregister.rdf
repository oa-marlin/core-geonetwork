 (Start: 1992 End: 1994) The history of development along the shores of Hobart's Derwent estuary made the river and bay system a natural choice for study by CSIRO's Coastal Zone Program. Contaminants such as metals and organic compounds have been accumulating for much of this century from the effluent discharges of industrial and urban activities. By the 1970s, the community was alarmed at the state of the river: chemical analyses indicated dangers to human health from eating filter-feeding shellfish such as oysters; some metals were above levels recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council; some beaches were dangerously polluted. In a detailed study by CSIRO's Division of Marine Research in 1992, chemists took water samples at the surface, near the bottom and sometimes in between every three months for nearly two years. The surveys provided a clear indication of inputs of some metals such as zinc, mercury and cadmium to surface waters in the middle reaches of the estuary. However, the input of most of these trace metals appeared to have decreased over the last 20 years. Pulp fibre is the main major source of organic pollutant in the upper estuary, and sewage in the middle and lower reaches.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project is a three-year survey of the Huon Estuary system in SE Tasmania, which is the site of a growing aquaculture industry. It will provide the scientific basis to improve the management of the Estuary and is part of a more general Huon Catchment - Healthy Rivers Project. Primary outcomes of the project will be: (i) a physical description of the estuary that includes simulations via a computer model; (ii) the effects of nutrients released from fish farms and other human activities compared with natural sources, and their relation with algal blooms; (iii) better scientific knowledge for aquaculturalists in managing their leases; and (iv) cost-effective monitoring strategies for industry and environmental managers.


 (Start: 1996 End: 1998) The Huon Estuary Study, which began in mid-1996, is one of the most comprehensive surveys of an Australian estuary. A pioneering CSIRO study, it will provide the scientific basis to improve the management of the Huon River estuary, with the valuable aquaculture industry as a focus. The three-year, $1.9 million study, funded in part by the Fisheries Research &amp; Development Corporation and under the umbrella of the Huon Catchment - Healthy Rivers Project, is assessing the environmental conditions of the waterway. Tackling the investigation will be a team of environmental scientists from CSIRO's Division of Marine Research, who are working with commercial fish farmers, Tassal and Huon Aquaculture, and with staff from relevant Tasmanian Government departments and agencies. The study should stand as a national model.

Many different types of tags have been used in fisheries, but none are suitable for penaeid reseeding.

Optimising the positional location of LC-&amp;#201;3-PUFA (e.g. SDA, EPA &amp; DHA) on dietary lipids molecules is therefore important for maximising their human nutritional value. Particular positional locations of &amp;#201;3-PUFA acids will also impact the functionality of the oils during food processing. It is also important for ensuring maximal transfer of these fatty acids into animal products when &amp;#201;3 oil sources are incorporated in livestock feeds.

      <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="urn:marlin.csiro.au:projectregister:conceptscheme:1.0"/>
      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project comprises a series of 5 surveys of giant crab (Pseudocarcinas gigas) habitats around Tasmania in waters of 150-350m depths, using video, multi-beam acoustic swath mapping, and sediment sampling, as a contribution to the joint TAFI/CMR project 'Understanding Shelf-break Habitat for Sustainable Management of Fisheries with Spatial Overlap'. Project aims include to define and map giant crab habitats, to describe the distribution of giant crabs in relation to habitat features, and to evaluate ecosystem links, the vulnerability of the habitat to damage by fishing, and the usefulness of video systems to obtain fishery independent information on giant crab abundance, sex ration, condition, and size. (Start: 2003 End: 2005) This is the CSIRO portion of the collaborative Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, University of Tasmania (TAFI)/CSIRO Marine Research Project titled 'Understanding Shelf-break Habitat for Sustainable Management of Fisheries with Spatial Overlap', which aims to map and understand shelf-break seabed habitats (~150-350m depths) around Tasmania, Australia, which is an area of interaction between two fishery sectors, giant crab trappers and finfish trawlers. Both of these have been expanding over the past decade, with potential to impact to target species abundance, habitat structure, and ecosystem structure. This project aims to research the habitat effects of these activities over the period 2003-2005 through sampling of fished and unfished areas using video transects, multi-beam acoustic swath mapping, and collection of physical samples using sediment grabs and benthic sleds, using chartered vessels and a voyage of the National Facility FRV Southern Surveyor in 2004.
Specific objectives for the giant crab (Pseudocarcinas gigas) habitat survey are as follows:
- define and map giant crab habitat on the shelf edge, at several key locations off the Tasmanian east and west coasts;
detail distribution of giant crabs in relation to habitat features;
- evaluate ecosystem links between habitats
evaluate the vulnerability of habitat to damage by fishing (trawls and pots), and
evaluate the ability to obtain fishery independent information by video on the abundance, sex ratio, condition and size of giant crabs.
The CSIRO portion of the work will comprise a series of five surveys to assess the seabed habitats of the giant crab at the edge of the continental shelf around Tasmania.</skos:definition>

Do individuals return to the Tasman Sea each winter? 4. Do all adult SBT make a migration to the spawning grounds each year? 5. Are there discrete areas in the NE Indian Ocean where SBT spawn (that could be closed to fishing as a method of controlling the take of SBT in the Indonesian fishery)? 6. How long do individuals spend on the spawning grounds?

Analyses will be reported annually to the CCSBT Stock Assessment Group and Scientific Committee, and the final report will be presented to the CCSBT and submitted for international peer review. The project results (ie. habitat preference and movement data collected by the PATs) will also feed directly into adaptive management models currently being developed as a collaboration between AFMA and CSIRO to assist the delineation of restricted access areas within the East Coast Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ET&amp;BF) at times SBT are migrating up the Australian east coast.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> (Start: 2005 End: 2007) The main goal is to learn how skilful Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are at making seasonal predictions, particularly targeted at the Upper Burdekin region of NE Queensland (which is a key region of WfHC). Where the models are not skilful enough on their own, investigate hybrid stats/model techniques for improving skill.
The basis of most current seasonal prediction schemes is the fact that El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events represent the greatest source of interannual climate variability beyond the seasonal cycle. There are numerous schemes of varying complexity providing predictions of ENSO events at long lead times (i.e. 3 to 12 months ahead in time). There is some debate about whether the relatively complex dynamical schemes (usually coupled ocean-atmosphere models) provide more skill than do relatively simple statistical schemes. Evaluations of skill have tended to focus on the ability of schemes to correctly predict sea surface temperature indices (such as NINO3 or NINO34). There have been few studies dealing with methods for converting seasonal predictions into useful information for the benefit of end-users.
In this study we consider the skill of dynamical seasonal prediction models and their potential application to Australian end-users. We consider which model outputs are most useful for the Upper Burdekin region where agriculture and water resource management decisions could be assisted.</skos:definition>

      <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="urn:marlin.csiro.au:projectregister:conceptscheme:1.0"/>
      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CSIRO has developed techniques to accurately estimate the age of SBT using otoliths (Gunn et al., in prep). The key object of the current proposal is to use these techniques to estimate the age of a subsample of SBT caught in the Australian surface fishery in the Great Australian Bight, and to construct an age-length key for the fishery to meet our CCSBT comitment. Although the CCSBT's immediate request is estimate the age of SBT sampled from the 2001-2 season, the ultimate goal is to estimate the age of SBT from the Australian catch annually. Since the number of otoliths collected during 2001-2 was relatively low (n=188) and very few small or large fish were sampled, the proposal also aims to include samples from the 2002-3 and 2003-4 seasons. This would allow a more robust analysis and construction of age-length keys for the fishery. We propose to determine the age of approximately 360 SBT under this project (120 from each of three seasons), and develop age-length keys for each of the three fishing seasons. Note that the CCSBT request for this type of information is ongoing, so that otoliths for the more recent season (2003-4) woul d have to be analysed in any case. At the CCSBT SC meeting in 2003, Morton and Bravington (2003) reported that between 100-200 otoliths from the furface fishery would be sufficient to provide accceptable precision (CVs under 20%). Otolith reading techniques developed by CSIRO were transfered to the Central Ageing Facility (CAF) in Victoria, as part of the CCSBT&amp;#25;s Age Estimation Workshop (Anon, 2002), and SBT sampled from the Indonesian longline fishery are already routinely aged by the CAF under a separate AFMA funding source. We propose to that CSIRO would select and extract SBT otoliths from the CSIRO hardparts archives that were collected from the Australian surface fishery, and arrange for them to be sent to the CAF for age estimation.

      <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="urn:marlin.csiro.au:projectregister:conceptscheme:1.0"/>
      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project is motivated by three interlinked issues. (1) The importance of CMR consolidating and demonstrating in the scientific literature its capacity for scientific support for integrated multiple use management. Such scientific papers are ultimately the benchmark by which scientific quality is judged, for the organisation and it&amp;#25;s individuals, and which attracts quality co-investment in research projects. (2) The importance of maintaining strong and positive links with WA regulators of the marine environment and industries. These WA regulators are very keen to make ongoing use of the understanding and products developed through NWSJEMS, both on the NWS and elsewhere, but currently there is no sufficiently capable WA agency to transfer this knowledge to. Ultimately SRFME (probably through &amp;#24;SRFME II&amp;#25;) should meet this need, but in the short to medium term the scientific capability and existing priorities of SRFME will greatly limit what can be done. There is a risk that WA will be unable to use the NWSJEMS understanding and products on the NWS and Ningaloo Reef, which will undermine CMR credibility in WA. Through this proposed project CMR will maintain a mechanism from which to build and deliver externally funded or co-investment application projects in WA. This should also help in the negotiation of SRFME II. (3) The desirability of exploring opportunities for CMR to apply the NWSJEMS understanding and products in area beyond WA. Many governments and regulators, within Australia and beyond, are actively seeking scientific support for integrated management of the human uses of marine ecosystems. Some of these developments are in existing WFO projects and others are under development.

(Start: 2004 End: 2006) </skos:definition>
      <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">WFO - National Framework for MSE: This project is motivated by three interlinked issues. (1) The importance of CMR consolidating and demonstrating in the scientific literature its capacity for scientific support for integrated multiple use management. Such scientific papers are ultimately the benchmark by which scientific quality is judged, for the organisation and it&amp;#25;s individuals, and which attracts quality co-investment in research projects. (2) The importance of maintaining strong and positive links with WA regulators of the marine environment and industries. These WA regulators are very keen to make ongoing use of the understanding and products developed through NWSJEMS, both on the NWS and elsewhere, but currently there is no sufficiently capable WA agency to transfer this knowledge to. Ultimately SRFME (probably through &amp;#24;SRFME II&amp;#25;) should meet this need, but in the short to medium term the scientific capability and existing priorities of SRFME will greatly limit what can be done. There is a risk that WA will be unable to use the NWSJEMS understanding and products on the NWS and Ningaloo Reef, which will undermine CMR credibility in WA. Through this proposed project CMR will maintain a mechanism from which to build and deliver externally funded or co-investment application projects in WA. This should also help in the negotiation of SRFME II. (3) The desirability of exploring opportunities for CMR to apply the NWSJEMS understanding and products in area beyond WA. Many governments and regulators, within Australia and beyond, are actively seeking scientific support for integrated management of the human uses of marine ecosystems. Some of these developments are in existing WFO projects and others are under development. So this project is essentially a bridging project &amp;#19; to allow CSIRO to consolidate the scientific benefits of the study after completion of NWSJEMS, to allow applications transfer of capability to CMR in WA, and to explore options for applications beyond WA.

The project, entitled Ecological Risk Assessment for Commonwealth Fisheries (ERACF) completed its first phase in July 2004. Stage 1 of the project involved the development of a method for undertaking ecological risk assessment for the effects of fishing (ERAEF), and its application to 14 of AFMA's fisheries (although full assessment has not been completed for all 14 fisheries). ERAEF is a hierarchical approach, moving from a broad but qualitative Level 1 analysis, known as SICA, through a semi-quantitative Level 2 (PSA), to a fully quantitative Level 3 analysis. At each level, lower risk activities and ecological components and units are screened out, while higher risks are either dealt with through a risk mitigation management response, or are evaluated at the next level. Moving to a higher level of analysis reduces the uncertainty, but is more demanding in terms of data, time and costs of analysis. Stage 1 of the project developed and applied the Level 1 and Level 2 analyses, but did not apply the Level 3 analyses to any fisheries. Further, the Level 2 analyses that were conducted for 20 sub-fisheries did not incorporate additional fishery specific data (such as catch data or spatial analysis of effort). The current Level 2 is based on general attributes of species and habitats often derived from Fish Base or from the literature. In addition, external review of the method identified improvements that could be made to the Level 2 analyses that would help further reduce the uncertainties associated with risk estimates. Although management actions can be taken on the basis of the current Level 1 and 2 analyses, AFMA has asked for further analyses at Level 2 before requesting MACs to advise on risk mitigation measures and responses.

(Start: 1991 End: 1997) The project was a five year study into the effects of trawling on seabed communities in the inter-shoal and inter-reef areas in the Far Northern Section of the Great Barrier Reef. The study arose from a GBRMPA convened scientific Workshop in 1989 to address the effects of fishing in the Great Barrier Reef region. The Workshop recommended that an experimental study of the effects of trawling should be carried out, taking advantage of the area closed to trawling (Marine National Park B) in the Far Northern Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. CSIRO and QDPI agreed to undertake the study, which was funded by these organisations as well as GBRMPA, FRDC and AFMA. Following the recommendation of the Workshop, the study was sited in an area known as the Green Zone between about 11°15'S and 11°45'S that was closed to fishing in 1985 as well as in the areas immediately to the north and south of the Green Zone. The study had several components: 
1. A collation and review of all known biological, oceanographic and fisheries information available on the study area.
2. A description of the study area. This included a survey of the sediments, epibenthos (animals living on the seabed), fish and prawns in the region.
3. Comparisons of the areas that are open to trawling with those that are closed to trawling.
4. A Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI design) manipulative experiment comparing areas that were subjected to the Impact of a single trawl coverage with untrawled Control areas.
5. A Repeat trawl experiment in which strips of seabed were trawled up to 13 times.

(Start: 1988 End: 1994) JERVIS BAY PROJECT
	The Royal Australian Navy proposed to move its fleet base and armaments depot to Jervis Bay, a pristine marine embayment on the south coast of New South Wales. In 1988 the Department of Defence contracted CSIRO to conduct baseline studies of the marine environment of Jervis Bay and develop a monitoring program to assist with the long-term management of the bay. The project, which took three years, was the most intensive baseline study of inshore marine habitats in Australia. The Jervis Bay Field Laboratory at HMAS Creswell has now closed; the remaining work is being completed at Marmion in Western Australia. The fourth progress report was submitted to the Department of Defence in January 1991 and the final report was prepared	 
	The aim of the Jervis Bay project is to determine the natural variability in the key habitats (saltmarshes, mangroves, seagrasses, sandy beaches, rocky shores and deep substrates) and key species (fish, seagrasses, mangroves, saltmarshes, and invertebrate fauna) in Jervis Bay over time, from 1988 to 1991, and space, taking in the whole bay. The variability in the patterns observed are being related to physical factors such as water circulation, water quality and climatic factors to develop a general understanding of the nature and inherent variability of the main ecological processes in Jervis Bay. From this quantitative baseline knowledge of the flora and fauna, a monitoring program is being developed to distinguish between natural changes and those caused by events such as oil spills, or erosion run-off, by new management strategies, or by the long-term impacts of climate change.</skos:definition>

There is almost no knowledge of how primary producers in the NW of Australia will respond to the environmental changes produced by dredging. Consequently, it is difficult to predict and then manage the impacts of dredging on these critical habitats with an acceptable level of certainty. This project will improve our understanding of how seagrasses are affected by dredging activities, and will apply that understanding to better prediction of impacts and management of dredging. A combination of laboratory and field experiments and field surveys will determine the levels of dredging-related pressures (or ‘thresholds’) that produce the earliest observable effects, sub-lethal effects and lethal effects on two species of seagrasses considered most ecologically important in the NW. The research will also determine the capacity of those seagrasses to recover from dredging-related stress. The research will focus on two of the most significant stresses produced by dredging: the reduction in light availability to plants; and the smothering of seagrass and algae as suspended sediments settle. The responses of seagrasses to dredging-related pressures will be characterised in order to identify plant or meadow features that can indicate the duration and the intensity of dredging-related stress that seagrasses have suffered. These indicators can be applied in monitoring programmes to identify stress and trigger management responses. The research will enhance the capacity of government and industry to predict the impacts on dredging on key benthic primary producer ecosystems and, in so doing, improve the certainty and timeliness of key approvals and regulatory processes.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">HEOBI Heard Earth-Ocean-Biosphere Interactions RV Investigator voyage IN2016_v01. Science Objectives:
Iron supply limits oceanic primary production in the Southern Ocean as well as elsewhere in the global ocean. We aim to test the hypothesis that hydrothermal activity driven by active submarine magmatism fertilises surface waters with iron thereby enhancing biological productivity. Heard and McDonald Islands on the Kerguelen Plateau are among the world’s most active hotspot volcanoes, and are type examples sourced from a particular geochemical component in the Earth’s mantle (enriched mantle 1, or EM1). Existing data indicate that fields of submarine volcanoes extend for several hundred kilometres away from the islands.

We will produce three-dimensional, high-resolution bathymetric, backscatter, and sub-seafloor maps of the seafloor surrounding the islands in near-real time. From this mapping and data from geotagged seals indicating locations of anomalously warm bottom water, together with deep tow camera imaging and TRIAXUS sensor data, we will identify candidate active submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal systems, and sample these volcanoes and their surrounding shallow sediments. In the water column over and downstream of these active volcanoes/hydrothermal systems, we will measure temperatures and obtain water samples for geochemical and biogeochemical analyses that will indicate the presence or absence of associated hydrothermalism and iron and other elemental enrichment. We will also sample the deep boundary current that impinges on the eastern flank of the Plateau, to investigate the generation of internal waves that enhance mixing of surface and subsurface waters, providing a mechanism to deliver iron enriched waters to the surface downstream of the volcanoes. If hydrothermally derived iron and other micro-nutrients are ascending to surface waters, we will compare our data to contemporaneous shipboard and satellitederived estimates of phytoplankton productivity and biomass to test for positive temporal and spatial correlations.
 
Should it be proven that hydrothermally derived iron exerts controls on the dynamics of plankton blooms, this will be the first demonstration of linkages between dynamic solid Earth processes (magmatism) and major biological processes (oceanic primary production). Plankton blooms, in turn, affect the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and sulphur, and ultimately influence the Earth’s climate system. Our results could therefore open significant new avenues of research in the solid Earth-Earth’s biosphere domain, including investigations of both past (e.g., oceanic anoxic events) and future (e.g., high atmospheric CO2) extreme Earth environments. This is an extract from the in2016_v01 Voyage plan.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v04, titled “Influence of temperature and nutrient supply on the biogeochemical function and diversity of ocean microbes.”

The goal is to resolve how changes in seawater temperature and nutrient concentrations, linked to shifting oceanographic circulation in eastern Australia, influences the diversity of microbial communities and the key biogeochemical transformations (C, N, P, Si, Fe and S) they mediate. The broader ecosystem implications for zooplankton, larval fish and marine megafauna will also be addressed.

Findings will be used to improve current biogeochemical and ecosystem models to increase their accuracy in forecasting changes in ocean productivity and biogeochemical fluxes in eastern Australia.

Scientific Objectives:
1. Characterise the diversity and function of microbial communities in the relatively warm EAC, against the relatively cool water of the Tasman Sea and adjacent shelf waters.
2. Conduct perturbation experiments to experimentally test the role of temperature and nutrients (particularly N and Fe) in microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations.
3. Assess the links between microbial biomass, size structure and carbon production with higher trophic levels  zooplankton, micronekton and cetaceansseabirds) in a frontal eddy(ies) relative to adjacent shelf and EAC waters.
4. Sample sediments to examine water-sediment geochemical processes and historical record of plankton.

There is currently very large uncertainty associated with the direct, semi-direct and indirect effect of aerosols on radiative forcing. A key feature in this regard is the influence on cloud properties of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the very small atmospheric aerosol particles necessary for the nucleation of every single cloud droplet. A recent analysis of the 35-year CCN concentration record at Cape Grim challenges the current accepted wisdom of the role of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) on CCN formation over the Southern Ocean. In particular, it appears that DMS oxidation is only significant during the summer months at Cape Grim, and in fact other sources and processes dominate throughout the rest of the year (Gras pers com). That other sources and processes may be significant in CCN production and modulation has also recently been suggested in a review of the CLAW hypothesis. The identity of these sources remains an open question. The work proposed here will be a positive step in addressing this question.

Instrumentation will run continuously in the Aerosol and Air Chemistry Labs whilst underway with no special requirements with regards to the vessel’s course or speed. On board work will involve the daily checking of instruments within the two labs and the storing of filter samples in the walk-in freezer.

In addition measurements will be taken at sea using hand held instruments outside on deck during good weather conditions.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Understanding the role of clouds in the warming and cooling of the planet, and how that role changes in a warming world is one of the biggest uncertainties climate change researchers face. A key feature in this regard is the influence on cloud properties of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the very small atmospheric aerosol particles necessary for the nucleation of every single cloud droplet. The anthropogenic contribution to CCN is known to be large in some regions; however, the natural processes that regulate CCN over large parts of the globe are less well understood, and particularly in the Great Barrier Reef. The production of new aerosol particles from biogenic sources (forests, marine biota, etc.) is a frequent phenomenon capable of affecting aerosol concentrations, and therefore CCN, on both regional and global scales. The biogenic aerosol particles therefore have a major influence on cloud properties and hence climate and the hydrological cycle. Determining the magnitude and drivers of biogenic aerosol production in different ecosystems is therefore crucial for the future development of climate models.

The fundamental questions that this study will address are:
1. What is the significance of this ecosystem as a natural source of aerosol particles?
2. How strong is this source at the regional level?
3. What is the mechanism of particle production over the GBR?

The biogenic aerosol particles therefore have a major influence on cloud properties and hence climate and the hydrological cycle. Determining the magnitude and drivers of biogenic aerosol production in different ecosystems is therefore crucial for the future development of climate models.

The fundamental questions that this study will address are:
1. What is the significance of this ecosystem as a natural source of aerosol particles?
2. How strong is this source at the regional level?
3. What is the mechanism of particle production over the GBR?

Scientific Objectives: Cloud-aerosol-precipitation processes over the Southern Ocean (SO) are one of the largest sources of uncertainties in future climate projections. The CAPRICORN proposal aims to advance our knowledge of the SO cloud systems, aerosol properties, surface energy budget, upper ocean biological aerosol production, and atmospheric composition, in order to improve the characterization of their physical properties from satellite platforms and global models. The cloud morphological, microphysical and thermodynamical properties and boundary layer structure are very poorly observed over the SO. Climate and numerical weather prediction models also poorly represent the cloud and precipitation fields over the Southern Ocean and, as a consequence, appear to poorly predict the energy balance. The objectives of this proposal are to (i) characterize the cloud, aerosol, and precipitation properties, boundary layer structure, biological production and cycling of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the upper ocean, atmospheric composition, and surface energy budget, as well as their latitudinal variability; (ii) evaluate and improve satellite estimations of these properties, and (iii) evaluate and improve the representation of these properties in the Australian ACCESS regional and global model.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Scientific objectives
The East Australian Current (EAC) is a major western boundary current that moves southward along the eastern margin of Australia. This current is climatically and biologically important as it exercises control over heat and nutrient distribution. The EAC is nutrient depleted to the north, but as it travels south, it entrains iron from a variety of sources – including riverine, sediment resuspension, eddies, lateral exchange of shelf waters, frontal jets and atmospheric dust inputs thereby elevating the concentration of dissolved iron. When the EAC reaches its southern extent, it breaks up to form eddy-like structures that become incorporated into the Subtropical Front (STF). The STF forms the boundary between warmer nutrient-depleted subtropical water and cool nutrient-rich Southern Ocean water. The waters southwest of Tasmania are nutrient-rich but depleted in dissolved iron, which is a typical characteristic of High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions within the Southern Ocean. In springtime, large phytoplankton blooms can be seen associated with a mingling of nutrient-depleted EAC waters with nutrient-rich, but iron depleted Southern Ocean waters in the vicinity of the STF east of Tasmania. Therefore, changes to the EAC caused by climatic shifts will have implications on elemental cycling, production, and local climate. We will assess the relationships between production and nutrient supply in the modern ocean while simultaneously improving our interpretations of past ocean records from the region.
The aims of this voyage are to:
• Assess the sources of external iron to the southern extension of the EAC
• Compare and contrast the biogeochemistry of EAC waters with HNLC waters located southwest of Tasmania;
• Determine the role of ‘new’ (externally sourced iron) versus ‘recycled’ iron in regulating springtime productivity across the STF;
• Test the sensitivity of neodymium and thorium isotope sedimentary records to local sedimentary processes.

Trace-gas and aerosol observations near the Great Barrier Reef will be made continuously throughout this transit voyage.

Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) sampling will also occur in conjunction with the AIR-BOX measurements. The CPR will be deployed during the longer legs of the transit (i.e. between CPR deployments and mapping surveys). CPR deployments will also be scheduled around the deployments of other towed equipment (e.g. SVPs). One cassette can be used to sample plankton on tows of up to 450 nm.

The size of the search area and the methodology used will, in part, be informed by the tools available and also the amount of time committed to the task. It is hoped that 6-12 hours searching and recording can be committed to the task although if successful early, less overall time will be required. If the voyage can only commit to passing through the search area once, or a far limited number of times, this is still a worthwhile exercise. 

In a multi beam or side scan sonar survey the lanes will be defined by the sonar coverage, taking into account the need for overlap to accommodate the gap beneath the sonar fish itself. As the sea bed terrain in the general area is flat it’s surmised that there will be little topography to create shadows and complicate interpreting the signal. We appreciate that multi beam is provided and the Heritage Branch can supply a side scan sonar if need be. 

Other than the side scan and multi-beam another commonly used tool is a magnetometer. Magnetometers are particularly good in search for the search of iron and steel wrecks. A search pattern within the search area using a magnetometer will be similar, with a fish towed following predetermined lanes. The magnetometer signal will be significant as this is a 2,500 ton steel ship in a relatively shallow seabed, although the device will need to be adjusted to accommodate the high ambient noise of the areas ferrous geology. A basic calculation taking into account the magnetometer, the size of the vessel and the depth of the water will determine the search lanes. 

Once the wreck is located the multi beam and/or side scan sonar will be used to take multiple impressions of the wreck. Adjusting the run of the ship will provide multiple perspectives of this complex archaeological site. ROV cameras are not listed on the ship equipment list, but other partners may be sourced to provide this. Remote video has been used on marine life surveys of wrecks in the Northern Territory previously. The ship’s bottom profilers will be used to determine heights of the seabed and wreckage to provide a profile of the wreck and guide future dive operations.

Once the wreck is located and a series of side scan runs over the wreck completed any further research on the marine survey of the wreck can be supported. Biological surveys may focus on the biodiversity of surface life, water column and wreck dwelling species. Side scan sonar can capture the scale and location of a ‘bait ball’ for example. ROV can be used to record wreck dwelling species and benthic life. Remote wreck surveys provide unique challenges for both maritime archaeologists and marine biologists, and the Macumba project will provide an opportunity to develop synergies and shape strategies to record these complex sites.

1) Conduct a modern survey in the primary shipping route through Bass Strait for the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO). This survey will facilitate safe navigation for international and coastal shipping and improve confidence for subsurface navigation in Bass Strait.
2) Undertake mapping of historic shipwreck sites, in partnership with Heritage Victoria and the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM). The primary activity of the GSM investigation of historic shipwreck sites is to conduct surveys of the purported site of SS Federal, to provide positive identification of the site and ensure its protection in future. This will be supplemented by opportunistic deployments of the drop camera (supported by SIT) in the event that the shipwreck is located. The location of shipwreck SS Federal was reported to Heritage Victoria by sport divers in 2012. Unfortunately, the provided coordinates were insufficient to narrow down the location. Subsequent attempts to communicate with the finders have been unsuccessful. Accurate location of SS Federal is a priority for Heritage Victoria in order to ensure adequate preservation and protection of this historic site into the future, in accordance with relevant heritage shipwreck protective legislation. Activities may also include opportunistic survey of three ‘unidentified targets’ located between the AHO mapping area and the search area for SS Federal. Aims are to positively identify these sites as cultural heritage targets (shipwrecks) via GSM and drop camera investigation, if time allows.
3) Training of Marine National Facility Operations and Support Team personnel in several routine and new underway and deployed systems, including:
- Multibeam patch test calibrations and backscatter calibration lines.
- Commissioning and trialling of new Brenke sled, Seaspy magnetometer (ahead of IN2019_V04) and RapidCAST SVP.
- Triaxus, CTD casts, multicorer, Smith Mac grab.
4) Seabird and marine mammal observations (Dr Eric Woehler, University of Tasmania):
This project will collect data to quantify the variability in the distribution and abundance of seabirds in the marine environment around Australia. The project will examine the relationships between physical oceanographic features and their use as seabird feeding areas. The study also seeks to identify species assemblages, or associations, in the species of seabirds observed that are persistent over time. The project will collect new data for seabirds around Australia, for which there are very few (and in many cases, nil) data. The project will use standard survey methods to ensure compatibility with existing data sets for the same species in other areas. Observations of marine mammals will also be shared with researchers to facilitate greater understanding of the role of oceanographic processes in the spatial and temporal distribution of marine mammals at sea around Australia. The project will also provide a context to current research efforts tracking seabirds and marine mammals, which are often constrained to a relatively low number of instrumented individuals relative to the population as a whole.

Equally it is not known how the characteristics of krill swarms affect the availability of krill to foraging predators.

To determine whether krill swarm characteristics influence predator distribution and behaviour this project will use the latest active acoustic multibeam technology to describe the density, distribution, and fine-scale 3D structure of krill swarms both within the vicinity of Antarctic blue whales and in control locations that are demonstrably distant from these specialist and extreme krill predators. Antarctic blue whales facilitate this study because their locations can be tracked in real-time from many hundreds of kilometres using passive acoustic technology explicitly developed to detect these whales’ loud, low frequency calls. Within whale aggregations the movement and foraging behaviour of blue whales will be described using tracking
technologies.

In addition, this project will facilitate the first field-based investigation of the controversial theory of ironfertilisation by whales. Through measurements of the abundance and speciation of whale faecal iron we will establish whether iron concentrations are higher within aggregations of feeding whales than within krill-only aggregations or than in adjacent areas. We will also determine whether whale faeces stimulates local production, alters phytoplankton community structure and growth, and its influence on nutrient cycling, nitrogen-fixation and biogenic climate gas production and the timescale of any effect.

This project could not only profoundly influence our view of the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem but will describe the potential dependencies of predators on krill in a form that may be limited in space and time. This information will inform the development of management systems for expanding Antarctic krill fisheries. (Start: 2019 End: ) </skos:definition>

We will achieve this by combining geophysical data collected from this voyage, with previously collected bathymetric and sub-bottom profile data and sediment cores to:

(A) Improve the bathymetric datasets available for the GBR continental slope and construct a comprehensive new inventory of the key landslides and canyons and their detailed geomorphic traits.

We will achieve this by combining geophysical data collected from this voyage, with previously collected bathymetric and sub-bottom profile data and sediment cores to:

(A) Improve the bathymetric datasets available for the GBR continental slope and construct a comprehensive new inventory of the key landslides and canyons and their detailed geomorphic traits.

(A) Includes some of the most diverse environments in the North Marine Region.

(B) Includes some of the most species-rich environments in the North Marine Region.

In addition, we will test the hypothesis that the raised seabed features (banks, shoals) in the park are relict reefs that formed at lower sea levels in the early Holocene period (ca. 12,000 to 7,000 years before present).

Results from this study will inform detailed implementation plans to be developed by the Department of Environment and Energy over the next 10 years.

1)Dredge volcanic and sedimentary rocks to obtain new, rigorous age and paleo-depth constraints for the Cascade Seamount. Underway bathymetric data will be used to refine dredge targets. 

2)Collect sediment cores across a depth transect to enable work investigating paleo-oceanographic conditions using proxies. Preferably at least a multicore proximal to IODP site 1172, and piston cores at the mid- and shallow-depth sites.

3)Collect high resolution swath bathymetry and sub-bottom profile data to see how far recent sediment flows extend from the Cascade Seamount towards IODP site 1172, to test the hypothesis that downslope transport resulted in the observed sediment patterns in core 1172. Existing coverage and resolution of bathymetry across the East Tasman Plateau is insufficient to resolve this question. 

4)CTD to complement the sediment core data if possible. Alternative is for clean underway surface supply samples to be taken where CTD not possible.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This project aims to determine the timing of the most recent collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet by examining the genomic signatures of benthic marine species with circumpolar distributions. Specifically, we aim to:
a. Develop panels of genomic markers for investigating genetic variation within target species
b. Establish demographic models of genetic connectivity through trans-west Antarctic seaways that may have existed during the warmer than present Last Interglacial (LIG), 125ka, based on the most probable Antarctic ice sheet reconstructions from models and geological data
c. Distinguish between these demographic models by testing their fit to genomic data
This proposal will enable discovery of when marine animals last migrated through historic seaways crossing the Antarctic continent, thereby indicating the most recent date of West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse.
This proposal will take full advantage of rock dredging during voyage IN2020_V01, and will require no deviations off route or additional time. Benthic animals have been retrieved this way for previous rock sampling on IN2016_V01 to the Kerguelen Plateau (Coffin et al). Therefore we anticipate that benthic samples will be obtained using the sampling protocols of IN2020_V01, including dredges and possibly Smith-Mac grabs.
