The Bismarck Air-Sea Interaction and Circulation Study (BASICS) and the Australia - Japan Equatorial moored instrument array study were conducted on this cruise. Cruise objectives included to measure all components of the heat budget of one or more parcels of water in the Bismarck Sea, measure the C02 flux over the ocean and relate its magnitude to the difference in C02 concentration between the water and the air, and to recover and redeploy the Australia/Japan current meter mooring on the equator at 147 degrees E. Survey methods included ADCP, CTDs, XBTs, underway, flying fish, micro-meteorological instruments, sensors, radiometers, drifting buoy, and various other instrumentation associated with the work. Water samples were collected for salinity, oxygen and nutrient analysis, and data from the various instruments were recorded for on board and laboratory analysis.

The second part (legs 2 and 3) carried out demersal trawling/benthic sampling in the South East fishery north of Darcys Patch. The third part (leg 4) carried out an ichthyoplankton survey and hydrological sampling between Bermagui (NSW) and Pt Hicks (VIC). Further sampling was carried out at a series of stations along the west and southern Tasmanian coasts.</skos:scopeNote>

Video images were obtained of fish behaviour in the BRD codends of the prawn net and the EFN, and of the performance of the EFN over benthic structure. Samples collected included bycatch species for reference specimens and saurids for the Hobart genetics group. Longlining was successfully used to demonstrate its effectiveness at obtaining large numbers of sharks over short time intervals including dyed bait experiments.</skos:scopeNote>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2017_v03, titled "Sampling the abyss: latitudinal biodiversity patterns along the base of Australia's eastern continental margin."

The primary objective of this voyage is to sample the biodiversity of lower bathyal (2500 m) and abyssal (4000 m) seafloor habitats off south-eastern Australia, and in particular deep-water ecosystems of seven Commonwealth marine reserves. We will also sample a few shallower stations at 300 m (to trial the Brenke sled) and at 1000m (to ensure a supply of live animals). The depth and sites listed below are indicative only, and may change slightly based on topography and weather.

To meet these objectives we will deploy a variety of gear to sample different components of biodiversity. The gear will also vary depending on the nature of the substratum (soft sediments or rock). The prime gear types include:
1.	Beam trawl (O&amp;A). This will only be used at sites with soft substrata
2.	Heavy sled (Sherman) (MNF). This will only be used for sites that are determined to be hard ground from the multi-beam data. Sherman must be deployed off a stern trawl winch, which will require shifting of a trawl door (there will be plenty of time for this operation as all the soft-sediment gear will not be used at a rocky site).
3.	Demersal trawl (NCRA) including floats (NCRA) &amp; doors (Antarctic Division), the latter will be mounted on the stern near the trawl winches when not in use. Soft sediment only.
4.	Brenke sled (MNF). Soft sediment or mixed soft-hard ground. It may require 2-3 floats to ensure it remains upright when deployed. It should be retrieved in an upright position using the A-Frame. A stand-alone CTD or camera can be mounted on the frame (see figure).
5.	Biological box corer (MNF, previously belonging to Geoscience Australia) of dimensions 500 x 500 mm, sampling size 0.25 m2 (soft sediment only). If possible, this is best deployed on the side winch.
6.	Deep-towed camera (MNF) with CTD
7.	Surface plankton &amp; mantra nets (O&amp;A and MV), including depression plate and flow meter.

In addition, we require multi-beam (Kongsberg EM122 &amp; EM710) and sub bottom profiler for seafloor mapping, and echo sounders for bioacoustics (particularly the Simrad EK60).

At each site, the procedure will be to first multi-beam the site to assess the distribution of rock and soft sediment habitats (if previous multi-beam data not available. This will guide the choice of gear and tow track. If the substratum contains mostly rock (possible for some 2500m sites), the heavy sled (Sherman) will be deployed. Otherwise a combination of beam trawl (with mounted camera), Brenke sled, demersal trawl and box core will be deployed. Box cores will be sub-sampled for sediment size and micro-plastics. For shallow water sites within CMRs, the deep-towed camera will be deployed instead of the box corer. The surface plankton net can be deployed during trawling (at appropriate slow ship speeds of under 2 knots).

On this voyage there will be a particular emphasis on ensuring that the animals are collected and preserved in excellent condition for photographic and genetic analyses. Keeping the animals cold is the key. Consequently, the catch will be transferred to chilled water (5°C) as soon as it safe to approach the sampling gear. The animals will be sorted, identified and photographed in chilled water to prevent DNA degradation. The box cores will be elutriated (animals separated from mud) in chilled water also (at least for the upper 2 cm). This will require a user-supplied system to chill water in the vessel's walk in cool room. The bulk ethanol and formalin will be stored in the HazMat container, as will the 25L plastic drums full of preserved animals.

Survey methods included CTD profiles, ADCP, plankton net tows and other associated instrumentation. Samples of water and plankton were collected for on board analysis and laboratory study. Preliminary sorting of the plankton samples indicated that the whiting larvae were patchy in their distribution, being found in ten samples from four generalised areas.</skos:scopeNote>

It is not intended that the ship be scheduled or conduct any research activities during the delivery voyage as the crew will not have been trained to operate the scientific winches and as such there will be no procedures established under the safety management system as these activities are planned to be established in slow time after arrival in Hobart. Also the number of personnel on board will need to be kept to a minimum during the voyage.
The Voyage Objectives are:
1.	To deliver a safe platform to Hobart.
2.	Crew familiarisation with the ship and equipment with the ship underway.
3.	Furthering of the implementation of ISM noting that the ship will have an interim Safety Management Certificate.  This will include such things:
4.	Furthering the production and testing of the Ship Security Plan for which an interim certificate only will have been issued priority to departure.
5.	Identifying other equipment considered necessary for the safe operation of the ship and which will be required to conduct research.
6.	Establishing shipboard routines 
7.	Conducting steady steaming trials to establish fuel and oil consumption data.
8.	Deviation to course to allow aerial footage during daylight hours - within 50nm of Fremantle.
9.	Operations team delivery voyage tasks are all focussed around preparation for arrival in Hobart and the beginning of Group 6 phases 4, 5 &amp; 6:
10.	The Ops team will participate in musters and drills and provide input and advice where appropriate related to support staff and science personnel.
11.	Assist with the development of ship inductions for visitors and voyage participants so that these are ready for arrival in Hobart.
12.	Familiarisation with the layout of the vessel. The key to planning safe and efficient operations and voyages is knowing the ship and how it works. The ops team will be responsible for training tour guides for WTP and for introducing MNF support staff to the vessel from arrival in Hobart. There are also areas in the Voyage Manuals and Documents that have been unable to be completed as the team is not familiar with the layout of the accommodation and recreation areas and the laboratories and science areas.
13.	Laboratories and science areas. The ops team have already begun planning and preparation for the sea trials and trial voyages out of Hobart. Familiarisation and testing to be able to advise potential trial voyage participants on equipment setup, location or facilities without ever having seen the ship.
14.	Fairing the towed body cable. The end few hundred metres of the towed body cable requires fairing to be fitted before the sea trials. The workshop has sent the required equipment to the ship and the Ops team members have agreed to spend a few hours each day taking turns at the task.
15.	Confirm container loading plan.
16.	Assess the options for makeup air and exhaust management for the radioisotope container.
17.	MNF Support staff groups (Electronics, Data Processing, GSM) will all be undertaking setup, testing and familiarisation of systems and equipment during the delivery voyage.  Also identifying any modifications/rectifications which may need addressing during Phase 4 work in Hobart. 
18.	Opportunistic swath mapping if appropriate.

The moored current meter array in the New Guinea coastal undercurrent is to directly measure the currents in and transport through Vitiaz Strait, PNG, over an annual cycle.  A line of five moorings were deployed across the strait from RV Moana Wave in Frebruary 1992 and the primary task of this cruise was to recover, service and redeploy the moorings, and to collect CTD and ADCP data for use in later interpretation of the moored data. Related cruises are FR 06/91 and FR 07/90.</skos:scopeNote>

Preliminary data reveal a property field rich in mesoscale and fine structure. At least two sharp property fronts between waters of subtropical South Indian and those of Pacific/Indonesian origin are evident near 18 deg. S and 16 deg. S in the upper 500 db. The change in salinity across these fronts is around 0.5. An extremely fresh 80 m thick layer was found north of about 13 deg. S. This layer appeared to be moving southwards at over 1 kt, a feature of the velocity field that persisted for the several days of sampling in that region.&lt;br&gt;

Cruise aims were to determine the abundance of the demersal fish community and the distribution and abundance of demersal habitats in each of the three experimental management zones, to collect data and samples for measurement of recruitment, growth and mortality in key fish species, to obtain taxonomic specimens of North West Shelf fish species, to use underwater photography to record fish and benthic assemblages associated with random trawl stations, and to conduct submersible data logger (SDL) transects. A rendezvous with a commercial trawler was also made to record underwater video footage of the interaction of commercial trawl gear with the benthos.

A rendezvous with a commercial trawler was also made to record underwater video footage of the interaction of commercial trawl gear with the benthos.
&lt;br&gt;
This voyage forms part of the North West Shelf study conducted by CSIRO Division of Fisheries between 1982 and 1991. Related voyages are Soela SO 5/82, SO 6/82, SO 1/83, SO 2/83, SO 4/83, SO 5/83, SO 6/86, SO 5/88; Pride of Eden PoE 4/89; Southen Surveyor SS 02/90, SS 04/91.</skos:scopeNote>

Cruise FR 04/99 will steam from Darwin to the Yampi Shelf hydrocarbon seeps where some bottom samples will be taken for the Australian Geographical Survey Organisation (AGSO), then steam to the start the main task, about 20 transects in an area between 15-20 deg S and 115-122 deg E in waters off the coast from Broome to Dampier.
The AGSO work will follow parts of the Yampi Tertiary Tie (YTT) seismic lines 8,9,10, acquire sediment samples to investigate benthic communities around hydrocarbon seeps. Also water samples, still and video images, high resolution shallow seismic profiles, and sea floor mapping data will be acquired. 
The major task is to investigate the Extension of cool-water carbonate facies into deeper waters in Australia's tropical North-West Shelf area : oceanographic, sedimentological, paleontological and geochemical history. Data collected will include Precision Depth Profiling, bottom sediment and biota samples, bottom water samples and CTD profiles, colour photography of the sea floor on camera and video stations and seismic lines.  Equipment includes epibenthic sled, Bleys dredges, Box corer, underwater camera, underwater real-time video system, seismic equipment and side scan sonar.

Joint Air-Sea Monsoon Investigation in the Bay of Bengal (JASMINE II).&lt;BR&gt;
This cruise follows one conducted in May 1999, using the US vessel R/V Ron Brown. The  aim of the cruises is to provide information of relevance to a number of questions regarding air-sea interaction in the eastern Indian Ocean, such as:&lt;BR&gt;
i) Is air-sea interaction an essential part of the "Intraseasonal Oscillation" events which control the net strength of the monsoon in a given year?&lt;BR&gt;
ii) Large currents occur in this region: does this imply that advection is a major part of the heat and freshwater balance?&lt;BR&gt;
iii) Can we close heat and freshwater budgets on the timescale of days, over a region a few kilometres wide?&lt;BR&gt;
Instruments used include: Radar recorder; Radiosondes; CTD sith 12 bottle rosette; ADCP; Eppley pyranometer; Eppley pyrogeometer; RM Young raingauge; Vaisala balloon launcher; Meterological balloons; Thermosalinograph; XCTD software; probes.</skos:definition>

Geophysical Experiment (Heinson/White)&lt;BR&gt;
The Carpentaria electrical conductivity anomaly is a major geological shear zone extending over a thousand kilometres in an approximately north-south orientation in northern Queensland.  It has been mapped on land by various geomagnetic and magnetotelluric arrays, but the relationship between the conductivity anomaly and major tectonic boundaries is not straightforward.  The offshore extent of the anomaly is unknown and poorly constrained by land measurements around the Gulf.  The scientific objectives are therefore to:&lt;BR&gt;
1. Map the location of the Carpentaria anomaly and examine its spatial relationship with the tectonic structures in the region.&lt;BR&gt;
2. To determine the depth and length of the anomaly into the Gulf, and hence better understand the causes of high electrical conductance within the crust.&lt;BR&gt;
3. To relate the electrical properties to the tectonic evolution of northern Australia.&lt;BR&gt;

Oceanographic Experiment (Tomczak)&lt;BR&gt;

The purpose of the study is to develop a ship-borne rainfall measuring system based on the navigational radar. The method of measuring rain with the ship's radar was previously tried during the R/V Franklin voyage FR0796. It was shown that the radar can successfully monitor spatial rain distribution around the ship, which enables quantitative estimates of area-average precipitation using the thresholding technique. In the present proposal we attempt to substantially improve the accuracy of radar rainfall measurements by using advanced radar signal processing and thorough calibration and validation of rainfall measurements.&lt;BR&gt;
Instruments used include Sea floor magnetometers, Acoustic recall system, FURONO Navigational Radar, Thermosalinograph, Bouy mounted Rainguages, Thoroid Bouys, Acoustic deck unit, Towed SP instrument.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Southern Surveyor Research Voyage ss2011_v04 Biological Oceanography of Western Rock Lobster Larvae - Part 2. Scientific Objectives: Lack of knowledge of Western Australia's fisheries oceanography fundamentally limits understanding of the recruitment of Western Rock Lobster, Panulirus cygnus, in a fishery worth $200-300 million/year to Australia. The life cycle of P. cygnus includes a planktonic "phyllosoma" larval stage that is transported up to 1500 km offshore via ocean currents. Development continues for approximately 9 - 11 months at sea, before juveniles ("puerulus")return over the shelf to recruit to coastal reef areas. Critical to improving the management of this fishery, which is under intensive review, is appropriate process information about the
oceanographic mechanisms driving coastal recruitment. The last three years of puerulus settlement have been low, with the latest (2008/09) settlement the lowest in 40 years of monitoring and not explained by the environmental factors previously identified as affecting settlement. The cause of the low settlement represents a key unknown for managers assessing the sustainability of WA's coastal fisheries, and is likely to be driven by variation in food availability during the open-ocean stage of the phyllosoma larvae. Our study will test the
hypothesis that the ocean productivity, particularly the nitrate-driven classic food chain supporting diatoms, copepods and other zooplankton, limits phyllosoma growth rate and survival in their oceanic phase. We will execute this study at, or after the peak, of the autumn/winter plankton bloom in the Leeuwin Current, with the aim of quantifying oceanographic parameters crucial to modelling rock lobster larval dynamics.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Southern Surveyor Research Voyage ss2011_v05. The influence of natural hydrocarbon migration and seepage on the geological and biological systems
of the offshore northern Perth Basin.
Scientific Objectives
1. Map sites of natural hydrocarbon seepage in the offshore northern Perth Basin (Jones,Kennard, Ross, Greinert) On the basis of:
 acoustic signatures in the water column, shallow subsurface and on the seabed;
 geochemical signatures in rock and sediment samples and the water column, and;
 biological signatures on the seabed: document the spatial distribution of seepage sites and characterise the nature of the seepage at these sites (gas vs oil, macroseepage vs microseepage; palaeo vs modern day seepage).
2. Investigate generic structural controls on natural hydrocarbon seepage in the offshore northern Perth Basin, to determine the leaking versus sealing nature of individual faults within linked fault systems (Jones, Kennard). Quantify seepage indicators over sealing structures through surveying the seabed over known oil and gas accumulations, then compare and contrast the results with indicators of seepage over structures with residual hydrocarbon columns that are known to have leaked or be leaking, then use these controls
to assess the leaking or sealing nature of other structures in a variety of environments.
3. Assess the influence and potential future impact of natural hydrocarbon seepage on geological and biological systems and anthropogenic activities in Australias southwest margin (Jones, Heap, Greinert). Determine whether the level of natural hydrocarbon seepage within the offshore northern Perth Basin:
a) is likely to impact climate change due to methane release in shallow water, b) is a control on benthic
habitat distribution, c) presents a natural hazard such as for drilling or slope stability, or d) has the
potential to change or influence petroleum prospectivity.</skos:definition>

A study of seasonal and interannual variability of recruitment of commercially 
important penaeid prawns is being undertaken in Albatross Bay, northeastern Gulf 
of Carpentaria. The offshore component involves sampling of adults, spawning females, 
larvae and recruiting subadults.&lt;br&gt;
AB86 was the Twenty-sixth monthly survey cruise planned for the Albatross Bay 
study area, for the period August 1989 to May 1992. This sampling is part of a 
longer term study, for which 40 cruises have been completed during the period 
March 1986 to May 1989. On this cruise, the set of 10 selected nearshore grids 
were sampled twice, and the set of offshore grids were sampled once.&lt;br&gt;
AB85 (Special Studies)&lt;br&gt;
1. Sample inshore grids established during AB77 to examine possible tiger prawn 
nursery areas.&lt;br&gt;
2. Sample selected inshore grids for larval prawns.&lt;br&gt;
AB86&lt;br&gt;
1. Carry out a trawl survey of prawn species distribution, size composition, population 
density and reproductive status in the study area.&lt;br&gt;
2. Carry out sampling for larval prawns at selected stations.&lt;br&gt;
3. Sample for phytoplankton species composition using a 37}i net. Filter samples 
for chlorophyll a level analysis at selected stations at 2 depths with replication 
during the cruise.&lt;br&gt;
4. Record numbers and species of turtles collected in trawl samples.&lt;br&gt;
5. Collect salinity and temperature profiles with the SDL at each plankton station.&lt;br&gt;
6. Collect live P. semisulcatus and P. merguiensis for transport to the Cleveland 
laboratory for maturation experiments.&lt;br&gt;
7. Spawn selected P. merguiensis females on board to attempt transport of live 
nauplii to Cleveland.&lt;br&gt;
8. Collect water samples for nutrient analysis.&lt;br&gt;
9. Collect samples of both immature and ripe P. semisulcatus for gut content analysis.&lt;br&gt;
10. Collect samples for Isotope analysis of three species at three depths into 
three size groups.</skos:definition>

Voyage Objectives:&lt;BR&gt;
We intend to conduct a multibeam survey, a magnetics survey and rock sampling in three areas along the Hunter Ridge. The questions which we are seeking to answer are as follows:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Kadavu and northern Hunter Ridge (area 1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Questions:&lt;BR&gt;
1) What is the lateral extent of adakites on the seafloor around Kadavu Is?&lt;br&gt;
2) What is the structural relationships between the northern Hunter Ridge and Kadavu Island?&lt;BR&gt;
To answer these questions we plan to do detailed swath mapping, sound-bottom profiling and dredge sampling in area 1. The use of the soundbottom profiler will be vital in determining whether the seafloor has a volcanic, sediment-poor, basement or alternatively the seafloor is formed by sediments. This information will significantly help the interpretation of the swath mapping.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rift Zone at the southern end of the Hunter Ridge (area 2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Question:&lt;BR&gt;
1) What is the distribution of different magma types withinthe rift?&lt;BR&gt;
To answer this question we wish to perform 10-15 dredges within the main rift zone between 1500-2500m water depth.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;North Fiji Basin propagating spreading centre (area 3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Question:&lt;BR&gt;
1) What is the age and rate of southward propagation of the spreading centre?&lt;BR&gt;
We plan to conduct a magnetic survey along 3 lines across the spreading ridge to obtain magnetic profiles. Due to the limited time during voyage SS10/2004 to conduct a detailed sampling of the spreading centre, we plan to do further sampling using a specially modified piston corer, designed for sampling glassy pillow rinds of young lavas.&lt;BR&gt;

nature and distribution of potential source rock intervals in the Bight Basin. Our current knowledge of the source potential of the basin is based on samples from wells drilled in proximal areas of the basin and geological models of the basin fill derived from seismic interpretation. This survey aims to sample the distal facies of potential source intervals of Albian-Santonian age at locations on the seaward edges of the Ceduna and Eyre Terraces. Furthermore, this survey aims to investigate potential natural hydrocarbon seepage at sites across the Ceduna Sub-basin, which may provide evidence for the presence of active petroleum systems (taken from SS01/2007 voyage plan).</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Voyage Objectives
Baseline carbon chemistry of the GBR. The objective of the voyage is to obtain the first detailed data on the mid to large-scale carbon chemistry of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) system. The voyage will only cover the dry winter months and future voyages may be needed to capture the variability through other seasons. The voyage will cover the region from the Kupuntutu Passage near Cape Direction in the far North to the Capricorn Group near Gladstone and include cross-shelf and along shelf variability. The data collected will provide an understanding of how the chemistry of Coral Sea waters that exchange with the GBR lagoon are modified by calcification and primary production, and will be a benchmark for assessing the progress of acidification on the GBR in future years. Samples will be collected using a combination of underway sampling from the ship's clean seawater supply, cross-shelf CTD sections extending into the Coral Sea, and by sampling along the axis of the GBR lagoon. The samples will be analysed onboard for carbon system parameters, nutrients, oxygen and salinity. An underway system will be used to continuously measure the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the surface waters and an equilibrator inlet mass spectrometer will be used to monitor oxygen/argon ratios to estimate net community production of the reef system....
Piggy-back Projects
Biology, geology and hydrodynamics of brittle star beds in dunefields and the biota of Halimeda mounds.

Aims:
i) the biological oceanography of small (&lt;50 km diameter, and possibly large) cyclonic eddies off the Stockton Bight in comparison to coastal waters, possibly in conjunction with an IMOS Slocum Glider in late 2008; and
ii) the ecology and vertical distribution of salps in shelf waters. The spatial pattern of sampling will take into consideration the synoptic and forecast oceanographic conditions from BlueLink.
Voyage Objectives:
Work will include EM-300 swath mapping, SeaSoar profiles including some sampling nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, TRP, Si), ADCP and CTD transects will be conducted. Plankton culturing experiments are also planned.

The major objective of the voyage is to determine the location of beds of high quality live, sub-fossil and fossil corals of SE Tasmania, that can subsequently by samples on the follow-up US vessel voyage. This objective will be met by deploying the Woods Hole Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE). A preliminary identification of probable areas of interest has been done based on analysis of high resolution topographic maps of the survey sites, from results of previous trawl samples of the area and from existing CSIRO video from which three broad areas of interest have been identified: The Southern Seamounts, the Tasman Fracture Zone and the South Tasman Rise. The second objective of the voyage will be to document the biodiversity of the deep parts of the Southeast Commonwealth Maine Reserve Network. The third objective of the voyage is to collect surface plankton samples for invertebrate larvae while steaming across the shelf.&lt;br&gt;

For Holmes &amp; Figueira, the main purpose on the voyage is to introduce University students to life and work on board an oceanographic research vessel, experience a variety of different sampling methods, carry out some on board experimentation and expose them to some of Australias deep sea fauna. The students will have two scientific aims:
1) to examine the deep sea fauna of the Bass Canyon and investigate how faunal composition changes with bathymetry and bottom composition;
2) to examine the distribution of larval fish along the Eastern shelf of Tasmania and conduct a series of onboard experiments to examine the relationship between temperature and otolith growth increments..............
For Kloser, the voyage provides an ongoing opportunity to use vessel transit time to complete a national mapping of the upper-mid slope seabed with multi-beam mapping and associated ecological interpretation...........

As part of a national seabed mapping initiative map the upper-slope and mid-slope seabed focusing on the 200 m to 1500 m depth range and regions important for regional marine planning, biodiversity and conservation assessments and fisheries habitat mapping.&lt;br&gt;
Objectives for the transit voyages:&lt;br&gt;
1.	Using transit time, map key areas as identified in gap analysis.&lt;br&gt;
2.	Develop methods of improving data quality and calibrating the EM300 backscatter data.&lt;br&gt;
3.	Develop and test new rapid methods of ground truthing acoustic backscatter maps with optical and physical sampling.&lt;br&gt;
4.	Process bathymetry and backscatter data and create maps suitable for ecological interpretation.&lt;br&gt;
The objectives to be accomplished on this transit are to complete a swath survey line from Hobart to Sydney, predominately along the 400m contour, map and resample reference sites at 100, 200 and 400 m and deploy XBTs and the CTD in order to provide calibration data for the swath mapper.</skos:definition>

Survey to support SER Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories and documented conservation values in scientific reference sites from selected MPA areas in the SER Estate.&lt;br&gt; 
The overall voyage objectives of leg 1 (SS11/20060 and leg 2 (SS02/2007) are to: 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate swath acoustic maps of target areas with the Simrad EM300 multibeam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect targeted biological, physical and photographic ground truth samples with a sediment grab, rock sled, epibenthic sleds and the CMR SVS or MVS camera platform form regions of upper continental slope seabed (~100-2000 m).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and curate benthic invertebrates to provide a biological inventory at various scales of taxonomic resolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Mostly biological sampling of seamount communities using sleds is planned for leg 2. Sample locations will be largely based on the mapping and photographic ground-truthing done on leg 1, if time permits and the weather is suitable, sampling will be completed on the South Tasman Rise and Cascade Plateau.

Equipment used on this voyage: CMAR deep towed video system, CMAR shallow towed video system, 35mm Photosea camera system, Sonardyne USBL tracking system, multifrequency acoustic pod, sherman and beam sleds.</skos:definition>
      <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Research Voyage: SS 02/2007: Southern Surveyor: Tasmanian Seamounts (Leg 2). Survey and monitoring for SE MPA's (proposed Huon and Tasman Fracture) including the Tasman Seamounts Marine Reserve. Leg 2. Allan Williams (CSIRO).&lt;br&gt;
Survey to support SER Estate inventory and management performance assessment by providing interpreted benthic habitat maps, faunal inventories and documented conservation values in scientific reference sites from selected MPA areas in the SER Estate.&lt;br&gt; 
The overall voyage objectives of leg 1 (SS11/20060 and leg 2 (SS02/2007) are to: 
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate swath acoustic maps of target areas with the Simrad EM300 multibeam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect targeted biological, physical and photographic ground truth samples with a sediment grab, rock sled, epibenthic sleds and the CMR SVS or MVS camera platform form regions of upper continental slope seabed (~100-2000 m).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and curate benthic invertebrates to provide a biological inventory at various scales of taxonomic resolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Mostly biological sampling of seamount communities using sleds is planned for leg 2. Sample locations will be largely based on the mapping and photographic ground-truthing done on leg 1, if time permits and the weather is suitable, sampling will be completed on the South Tasman Rise and Cascade Plateau.

The overall scientific objective is to obtain frequent measurements of surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean, and then onwards to the ocean interior in the form of sinking particles. This biological pump drives carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and writes the sedimentary record. The controls on its intensity
are complex and involve processes that vary on daily, weekly, seasonal, and interannual timescales. Obtaining observations with the necessary frequency is not possible from ships. For this reason the NCRIS IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series Facility seeks to obtain this information using automated sensor measurements and sample collections.
This voyage will deploy for the first time the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS-1)
mooring to obtain in-air and in-sea measurements to better understand the exchange
of heat, moisture, and gases between the ocean and atmosphere. It will also recover
the Pulse-6 mooring that has been making measurements of temperature, salinity,
mixed layer depth, photosynthetically available radiation, oxygen, total dissolved gases,
and phytoplankton fluorescence and backscatter. The Pulse-6 mooring also collects
24 paired water samples, approximately weekly, for later measurement of dissolved
nitrate, silicate, inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity.

Physical forcing of productivity on the Kimberley Shelf.
Scientific Objectives
We propose to investigate the biogeochemical (BGC) cycling in the shallow seas of the Kimberley shelf. Our conceptual model of the region links primary production to the balance between light limitation (due to turbidity), nutrient supply and water column stability. The interaction of these factors can generate aggregations of zooplankton and larval fish communities at the turbidity maxima. A major focus will be quantifying the nutrient inputs from the tidal forcing at the shelf break, from terrestrial runoff or benthic recycling. Based upon the observations and modelling we will assess the impact of climate variability on nutrient pumping across the shelf break. In addition the interaction between the river outflow and tides on two time scales (single tidal cycle [12h] and spring-neap cycle) will be investigated in terms of physics (including underwater light), chemistry and biology.

The Biological Oceanography of Western Rock Lobster Larvae.
Scientific Objectives
Lack of knowledge of Western Australia's fisheries oceanography fundamentally limits understanding of the recruitment of Western Rock Lobster, Panulirus cygnus, in a fishery worth $200-300 million/year to Australia. The life cycle of P. cygnus includes a planktonic "phyllosoma" larval stage that is transported up to 1500 km offshore via ocean currents. Development continues for approximately 9 - 11 months at sea, before juveniles ("puerulus") return over the shelf to recruit to coastal reef areas. Critical to improving the management of this fishery, which is under intensive review, is appropriate process information about the oceanographic mechanisms driving coastal recruitment. The last three years of puerulus settlement have been low, with the latest (2008/09) settlement the lowest in 40 years of monitoring and not explained by the environmental factors previously identified as affecting settlement. The cause of the low settlement represents a key unknown for managers assessing the sustainability of WA's coastal fisheries, and is likely to be driven by variation in food availability during the open-ocean stage of the phyllosoma larvae. Our study will test the hypothesis that the ocean productivity, particularly the nitrate-driven classic food chain supporting diatoms, copepods and other zooplankton, limits phyllosoma growth rate and survival in their oceanic phase. We will execute this study at, or after the peak, of the autumn/winter plankton bloom in the Leeuwin Current, with the aim of quantifying oceanographic parameters crucial to modelling rock lobster larval dynamics.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Southern Surveyor Transit Voyage SS2010_T02, Fremantle to Hobart.
Scientific Objectives
The Benthic Protection Zone (BPZ) of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park (GABMP) was proclaimed in 1998, and consists of a 20 nautical-mile-wide strip of seafloor orientated north to south and extending from three nautical miles from the coast to the edge of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), 200 nautical miles offshore (Figure 1). Within this zone, the benthic assemblages are protected from demersal trawling and other potentially destructive human activities.
The BPZ is presently one of fourteen temperate Commonwealth Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Australia. These MPAs form part of an integrated strategy for marine conservation and management through the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA). At present, no data are available on the benthic biodiversity of the continental slope of the BPZ, or the environmental factors that affect their patterns of distribution and abundance. This research addresses this knowledge gap and aims to provide quantitative information on the regional significance and diversity of the deep-water faunal communities of the BPZ.

Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Facility 3. Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) moorings for climate and carbon cycle studies south-west of Tasmania(47°S, hundred and 40°E).
Scientific Objectives
The overall scientific objective is to obtain frequent measurements of surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean, and then onwards to the ocean interior in the form of sinking particles. This "biological pump" drives carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and writes the sedimentary record. The controls on its intensity are complex and involve processes that vary on daily, weekly, seasonal, and interannual timescales. Obtaining observations with the necessary frequency is not possible from ships. For this reason the NCRIS IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series Facility seeks to obtain this information using automated sensor measurements and sample collections.
This Voyage will:
i) deploy the Pulse-7 mooring
ii) recover the SAZ-12 (and redeploy as SAZ-13) deep ocean sediment trap mooring
iii) service the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS-1) mooring deployed on SS1002 in April 2010
iv) carry out underway and CTD based measurements
v) deploy autonomous profiling floats and an ocean glider

Krill in 3-D - Vertical stratification and spatial distribution of krill communities in the East Australian Current.
Scientific Objectives
Marine predator-prey relationships should remain within certain boundary conditions (Michener and Kaufman, 2007), but few examples consider interspecific interactions in planktonic communities in pelagic marine ecosystems (Hairston et al., 1960; Schlosser, 1982). These ecosystems are often structured with high species diversity at lower and higher trophic levels, but a lower diversity of secondary consumers at mid trophic levels (i.e. a wasp-waist ecosystem, Bakun, 2006), such as pelagic fishes. Euphausiids (krill) likely represent an invertebrate analogue to pelagic fishes in these systems (Bakun, 2006), but this concept is yet to be explored. Competition between larval euphausiids and abundant primary consumers capable of dominating ecosystem resources (i.e. salps) likely control the progression toward a wasp-waist structure, and these competitive interactions are potentially mediated by connection between epipelagic and mesopelagic food webs.
The epipelagic and mesopelagic zones of the ocean are defined as 0 to100 m (euphotic zone) and 100 to 1000 m depth respectively. Greater than 90% of the organic matter exported from the epipelagic zone is remineralised into nutrients, microelements and CO2 in the mesopelagic zone, and returned to the surface on decadal scales or less (Karl et al., 2008). The mesopelagic zone therefore significantly dampens the downward transfer of organic matter to the deep ocean, and acts as a positive feedback to global warming. Despite their importance in understanding the efficiency of the biological pump, little is known about the processes that control the remineralisation of CO2 in the mesopelagic zone, or its regional variation. These are considered to be related to the structure of, and relationship between, the epipelagic and mesopel</skos:definition>

Areas of seabed in Commonwealth waters off temperate Australia are being closed to fishing as marine reserves are developed by the DEHA, and as spatial closures are increasingly used by AFMA to manage fishery stocks. One current focus for both conservation and fishery closures is the protection of gulper sharks which are under consideration for endangered species listing. Other species and habitats................&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Voyage Objectives&lt;br&gt;
1. Map and characterize the benthic ecosystem of the 60-mile closure in the GAB using the EM300 multibeam and quantitative towed camera surveys&lt;br&gt;
2. Quantify the abundance of gulper sharks and associated species, inside and outside the closure by non-extractive quantitative towed camera surveys.&lt;br&gt;
3. Estimate species relative abundances inside and outside the 60-mile closure using non-extractive underwater baited video cameras (BRUVs).&lt;br&gt;
4. Assess the survivorship by gulper sharks and other species following tagging. This will use a specially designed trap with (1) a surveillance camera to monitor behaviour during descent, on the bottom, and during ascent, and (2) an acoustic receiver to track fish movements away from the trap after release.&lt;br&gt;
5. Evaluate movement in and out of the 60-mile closure using two curtains of acoustic VR2 listening stations to detect fish tagged with acoustic V16 tags.&lt;br&gt;
6. Acquire additional deepwater camera calibration data with scalebar and rotating 16-laser array......&lt;br&gt;

Crocos (CSIRO) during March 1992.&lt;BR&gt;Cruise Objectives (taken from Cruise Report)&lt;BR&gt;A study of seasonal and interannual variability of recruitment of commercially important penaeid prawns is being undertaken in Albatross Bay, northeastern Gulf of Carpentaria. The offshore component involves sampling of adults, spawning females, larvae and recruiting subadults.&lt;BR&gt;
This was the Twenty-fifth monthly survey cruise planned for the Albatross Bay study area, for the period August 1989 to May 1992. This sampling is part of a longer term study, for which 40 cruises have been completed during the period March 1986 to May 1989. On this cruise, the set of 10 selected nearshore grids were sampled twice, and the set of offshore grids were sampled once.</skos:scopeNote>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Impact of the East Australian Current on water chemistry, bio-optical properties and coastal primary productivity in the NSW region.

Scientific Objectives
The East Australia Current is the single-most important factor affecting regional productivity along the eastern seaboard of Australia, yet we do not have a good measure of its strength, variability or a complete understanding of its biological impact. This voyage seeks to better understand the interaction of the EAC with the continental shelf in the area north and south of the EAC separation zone off NSW, an important region supporting almost 50% of Australians living near the coast. High-resolution data will be collected to characterise the relationship between physical oceanography, water chemistry (e.g. nutrient distribution and light availability) and primary and secondary productivities.
Phytoplankton are responsible for &gt;40% of global photosynthesis and are the energetic 'base' of marine foodwebs (Falkowski and Raven 2007). Their productivity is generally determined by the provision of nutrients and light and the degree of herbivorous grazing. It is therefore critical to understand these inter-relationships in order to parameterise this complex and dynamic marine environment for biogeochemical and ecosystem models.
This project will use traditional as well as innovative techniques to assess productivity (14-C uptake and bio-optical and fluorescence-based estimates of production) as well as grazing losses. In addition, bio-optical biogeochemical quantities will be measured in-situ and provide much needed data for the wider NSW scientific community to improve remotely-sensed estimates of ocean colour (chlorophyll-a biomass). Shifts in the composition and function of bacterial communities will be assessed using metagenomic approaches and will be related to specific oceanographic features and phytoplankton community characteristics. Finally, nutrient and organic source (fulvic acid) enrichment</skos:definition>

Scientific Objectives: The Australian Tsunami Warning System (ATWS) is a national effort involving the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau), Geoscience Australia (GA) and Emergency Management Australia (EMA) to provide a comprehensive tsunami warning system capable of delivering timely and effective tsunami warnings to the Australian population by 2009. The project also supports international efforts to establish an Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, and contributes to the facilitation of tsunami warnings for the South West Pacific.
Due to the complexity and uncertainty as to whether an undersea earthquake has the potential to generate a tsunami, the observation of sea levels is a critical factor in verifying whether a tsunami has actually been generated. The use of actual sea level observations, as compared with reliance on seismic observations alone, therefore helps to significantly reduce the risk of false tsunami warnings being issued. All Australian-owned buoys, as well as deep-ocean buoys operated by other countries in the Australian region, provide critical data to Australia's tsunami warning system.</skos:definition>

There are 2 principal objectives, plus 2 minor ones [one being listed as a piggy-back 
project].&lt;BR&gt;
The first objective is to study large holes that have been found during the AUSCAN 
2003 cruise offshore the Murray Canyons Group offshore Kangaroo Island. These 
holes occur along possible tectonic lineaments from depths between 4,500 and 5,500 
m. Water samples [for water chemistry and microbiology] and short cores will be 
taken in some of the holes in an attempt to determine their mode of formation.&lt;BR&gt;
The second objective is to determine, by means of swath mapping and sub-bottom 
profiling, the location of several of the ancient meanders of the River Murray 
that would have been formed during periods of low sea level on the very broad 
Lacepede Shelf. An attempt will be made to link the meanders with the heads of 
the various canyons of the Murray Canyons Group, and determine if erosion 
is currently active at those locations. Short cores will be taken on the Lacepede 
Shelf in an attempt to find a high-resolution Holocene record of fluvial outwash 
of the Murray. CTD measurements will be taken along some of the meanders to determine 
whether they act as conduits of continental, fresh waters.&lt;BR&gt;
A minor objective is to follow and map in several places the low sealevel stand 
that occurred 20,000 years ago and dredge wherever possible suitable material 
for dating and geochemical analysis. (taken from National Facility Voyage Plan SS02/2006)</skos:definition>

Scientific Objectives - The focus of this program is to give students a taste of what it is like to live and work on an ocean going research vessel and to expose them to some of the different sampling methods and equipment that are used in biological research programs.  The students will have three (quasi) scientific aims, which will contribute to our knowledge about Australian waters, as follows: 1) to characterise the macro-fauna inhabiting a unique geological feature (reef) off the coast of Wollongong; 2) to examine the effect of depth on species composition in Bass Canyon and 3) to examine the trophic relationships between euphausids and larval fish, extending the work of the Taylor cruise (ss2010_v08). To a large extent aims 1 and 2 align with those of Dr Rudy Kloser (CMAR) and complement the piggyback project of Dr Ronald Thresher, which will provide the students with a window into another benthic habitat. For Kloser, the voyage provides an ongoing opportunity to use vessel transit time to complete a national mapping of the upper-mid slope seabed with multi-beam mapping and associated ecological interpretation. The upper-slope and mid-slope seabed 100 m to 1500 m depth range, are regions important for regional marine planning, biodiversity and conservation assessments and fisheries habitat mapping. On this voyage we will use a ongoing and developing piece of equipment, the Benthic Optical Acoustic and Grab sampler (BOAGS), which can survey, by video and acoustically, and selectively sample (surface fired Smith-Macintyre grab) the benthos. The benthic sampling carried out by the students will supplement BOAGS. Conversely and importantly, BOAGS will allow the students to survey a much broader area and ensure the correct gear is deployed, thereby increasing their exposure to deep sea fauna.

Scientific Objectives: This voyage will characterise deep-water pelagic and benthic community structure and identify key ecological processes in the central and eastern GAB, and forms part of the GAB Research Program that aims to describe the key elements of the GAB marine ecosystem. This understanding of the structure and function of the ecosystem will be used to inform future integrated and sustainable ocean management and assessment/mitigation of potential future impacts. An overarching objective of the voyage is to contribute to developing models of ecosystem-level structure and function for the GAB

The pelagic ecosystem structure in the eastern GAB, which is characterised by seasonal upwelling and a narrower continental slope, will be compared with the poorly sampled central GAB, where year-round downwelling is predicted and the shelf and slope are wider with the following GAB Research Program objectives; 

1.Compare the eastern and central GAB continental margin zooplankton and micronekton communities in terms of their species composition, size range, biomass, nutrient source/trophic pathways and habitat.
2.Testing the hypothesis that the "microbial food web" is the dominant planktonic food web over the deep GAB continental margin, particularly in the central GAB where year-round downwelling is thought to be the prevailing cross-margin flow, and that the more efficient "classic food web" only dominates in the eastern GAB during periods of nutrient-rich upwelling. 
3.Describing the community structure, dynamics, biodiversity and endemism of microbes (i.e., viruses and bacteria), plankton (i.e., phytoplankton, zooplankton, ichthyoplankton) and micronekton (including squids, small pelagic and mesopelagic fish and gelatinous organisms).

Benthic characterisation is important because there are virtually no existing benthic biological data beyond continental shelf depths (&lt;200 m); because conservation values attributed to Commonwealth Marine Reserves (CMR) spanning wide depth ranges are untested on the mid- and lower continental slope; and because oil and gas lease areas extend across the GAB Marine Park (GAB MP).  

Within the GAB Research Program, the Benthic Biodiversity project has the following objectives:
1.Quantify spatial patterns in the physical environment, and composition and abundance of benthic fauna in BP leases and adjacent continental slope areas of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) to provide baseline metrics relevant to monitoring the potential future impacts of oil and gas exploration on benthic communities.
2.Determine requirements (including identifying indicators and metrics), and identify suitable control sites, for future ecological monitoring in the GAB - especially to detect and quantify ecological impacts from oil and gas exploration on benthic communities of the GAB Marine Park.

&lt;LI&gt;To determine the interaction of coastal currents, phytoplankton dynamics and trophic transfer in the coastal waters of southern Australia.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Voyage Objectives&lt;BR&gt;
From Esperance, Southern Surveyor will conduct 17 cross-shelf transects (Figure 1). For each transect, 10-15 CTD stations will be occupied depending on the shelf width. The transects will extend from the coast (~30m isobath) to the 2000m contour. As in previous voyages, stations will be located at 50m depth intervals, especially along the continental slope. In addition to the standard CTD and fluorescence, nutrient data will also be collected. At selected stations Bongo nets will be deployed to obtain zooplankton samples.&lt;BR&gt;
Process studies (using ADCP measurements and high resolution CTD stations) will be undertaken at a submarine canyon (located between transects K, J and I, Figure 1) to examine the fine-scale features of the effect of topography on the currents.&lt;BR&gt;

Scientific Objectives:
This project will undertake an integrated oceanographic transect and
dust monitoring program for iron, other trace elements, and their isotopes (TEIs)
along the western end of the GP13 zonal section (~30oS) east of Australia.
Our innovative measurement and analysis strategy will identify processes and
quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key TEIs in the southwestern Pacific
Ocean, and establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental
conditions. We will use a series of novel techniques to fingerprint the sources,
sinks and internal cycling of TEIs, focussing on the atmospheric delivery of irondust
to the remote ocean. This project will provide maximum scientific reward for
evaluating future global change, and has strong international collaborative activity
under the auspices of the international GEOTRACES (www.geotraces.org) program.
Outcomes of this project will be an improved ability to predict climate-driven
changes in the supply and biogeochemistry of trace elements in ocean waters
around Australia. Our research will quantify the importance of atmospheric dust
for marine ecosystem health, help inform Government policy on ocean iron
fertilisation as a carbon sequestration strategy, and provide a broad basis for evaluating future climatic changes in coupled atmospheric  ocean processes. Extracted from voyage plan, please read plan for full details.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Towards an understanding of mid-trophic biomass, distribution, variability and energetics in ocean ecosystems.
Scientific Objectives:
The water column comprises more than 90% of the earths living space and its deep
water component is probably the largest and least-known major faunal group on
Earth despite its obvious importance at the global scale (Robison, 2009). Biological
communities in these habitats are dominated by meso-zooplankton and micronekton
(fishes, crustaceans, squids and gelatinous zooplankton, 2-20 cm length) that are
crucial to the foodwebs of pelagic and demersal predators (e.g. Bulman et al. 2001.
The micronekton of the ocean is involved in a vertical migration from deep to shallow
depths and, again, while little understood, probably accounts for the bulk of global
ocean biomass. This ecological system is under threat from a broad range of influences
including climate change and carbon dioxide (ocean acidification) (Robison, 2009).
The Tasman Sea is a high priority region as it is predicted to be a global temperature
change hot spot (Cai et al., 2005). This large predicted temperature shift in the
Tasman Sea will have major impacts on the structure and function of the ecosystem
from biogeochemistry, plankton, micronecton and nekton to depths in excess of 400
m. During this voyage we will be refining methods to interpret basin scale acoustic
sampling with targeted mid-water net sampling and multi-frequency acoustic and optical
sensing. This refinement will contribute to the IMOS bio-acoustic sampling program.</skos:definition>

Scientific Objectives: The focus of this program is to give students a taste of what it is like to live and work on an ocean going research vessel and to expose them to some of the different sampling methods and equipment that are used in oceanographic research. The students will have two (quasi) scientific aims, each of which will contribute to our knowledge about Australian waters, as follows: 1) to characterise the macro-fauna inhabiting the benthos at range of depths along Australias southern coast; 2) to investigate regional surface productivity (POM) and the distribution of pelagic organisms along the southern shelf of Australia. 
For Kloser, the voyage provides an ongoing opportunity to use vessel transit time to complete a national mapping of the upper-mid slope seabed with multi-beam mapping and associated ecological interpretation. 
For Reisser, the voyage will facilitate her ongoing research on the distribution, abundance and composition of floating marine debris (FMD) around Australia. Marine debris has become a major hazard to marine life and is also leading to aesthetic degradation, economic losses and human health hazards. At present, limited data exist to quantify and explain the geographical range and content of marine debris in our oceans. Extracted from the voyage plan MNF_ss2011_t03_plan.pdf.

&lt;i&gt;Voyage Objectives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To study the space - time distribution of the volcanic activity in order to investigate its relationships to the tectonic development fo the South Bismark Microplate, with the aim of understanding deviations from the normal patterns of volcanic activity associated with subduction and termination of subduction.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Scientific Objectives&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To build on background reconnaissance carried out by previous expeditions (FR 02/2002 and RV Kilo Moana 0419) in the submerged protions of the Bismark Arc in order to characterise the petrogenesis and tectonic setting of the previously unknown volcanic centres. Dredging and sticky wax coring will recover fresh glassy volcanic rock samples. Glasses and bulk rock samples will be analysed for major, trace and volitile elements together with isotopic abundances to determine the volatile contents and melting processes, identify mantle sources including "Indian"-type and possible Manus plume components, and hence obtain insights into upper mantle flows associated with arc-continent collisopn on the northern margin of the Australian Plate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To test young volcanic features for evidence of associated hydrothermal activity. This will be done using a similar plume-location and characterisation approach used on previous voyages by the Chief Scientist and his collaborators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

Gardner Banks to Gardner Reef. Scientific Objectives: On a global scale, coral reefs are experiencing a period of rapid change. The world has effectively lost 19% of the original area of coral reefs since 1950, with the loss predicted of 35% of coral reefs in the next 40 years (Wilkinson, 2008). About 46% of coral reefs are regarded as healthy except for currently unpredictable global climate threats, which includes the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The observed shift of average marine climate zones south by &gt;200 km since 1950 (Lough, 2008) could potentially result in the GBR extending south, causing an algal to coral phase shift as coral settlement follows the changing environmental gradient. 
The shelf adjacent to Fraser Island is located at the transition between tropical carbonates (GBR) to the north and cool-water carbonates to the south (Schröder-Adams et al., 2008) and represents an ideal natural laboratory to investigate this phase shift. The projected warming trend in SST would anticipate a phase shift from a red algal-dominated substrate to a coral-dominated substrate. A hypothesis is that Gardner Bank would form an antecedent surface for future coral reef development through net coral framework accretion. In effect, Gardner Bank would become Gardner Reef, therefore it is crucial that the extent, structure and morphology of this potentially important site be investigated.

Scientific Objectives
The East Australian Current (EAC) is a complex and highly energetic western boundary system in the south-western Pacific off eastern Australia. It provides both the western boundary of the South Pacific gyre and the linking element between the Pacific and Indian Ocean gyres. This voyage will deploy an array of full-depth current meter and property (CTD) moorings from the continental slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (26oS). At this location the EAC, north of the high eddy variability, the approaching its maximum strength and its flow is relatively uniform and coherent. The aim of this observing system is to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC. 
This a component of IMOS, and will provide an intensive reference set of
measurements of the EAC flow over sustained period for monitoring EAC transport,
improved understanding of relationship of EAC and the South Pacific gyre and
impact of the coastal marine ecosystem, and validation and interpretation of the current system in numerous climate and ocean models. The mooring array is located on the existing long-term XBT transects, satellite altimetry and glider
tracks. The EAC deep mooring array will be complemented by a Queensland-
IMOS operated inshore mooring array on the continental shelf region.(Extract from the voyage plan, please see plan for full details.)</skos:definition>

Demise of the former Vitiaz Arc has led to the establishment of a new Australian-Pacific plate boundary that wraps around the north end of Fiji, and connects with the Tonga Trench via a set of ridges (e.g., Futuna Spreading Centre, Northwest Lau Spreading Centre), rifts (e.g., Rochambeau Rifts), transform faults, and extension zones (Fig. 1b). Voyage ss2012-v02 will explore via a west to east reconnaissance of these tectonic elements, the accompanying magmatism and hydrothermal activity.

Scientific Objectives
The objectives of this voyage are to investigate;
1. The crustal nature of the Gulden Draak Ridge, Batavia Knoll, and Dirck Hartog ridge
-continental and/or volcanic - in order to further constrain plate tectonic models of the early separation between India and Australia and also to understand the interaction between the seafloor-spreading system and volcanism related to theKerguelen hotspot. This objective relates primarily to Nathan Daczko and Jacqueline Halpin.
2. The age and formation history of the 'de Gonneville Triangle'. This piece of oceanic crust is located at what was the triple junction of rifting between Australia-India-Antarctica. Understanding the de Gonneville Triangle is
especially important because prior to Australia-Antarctic break-up it was immediately adjacent to the Enderby Basin, and the two basins should reveal the same magnetic anomaly patterns but current interpretations reveal considerable discrepancies. This objective relates primarily to Joanne Whittaker, Dietmar Müller and Simon Williams.
3. The age distribution of oceanic crust across both the east and west Perth Abyssal Plain.Acquiring ridge-perpendicular magnetic anomaly profiles are crucial in order to constrain the early spreading history between India and Australia and the prebreakup fit between India-Antarctica and Australia. Of particular importance is the oceanic crust located southwest of the Dirck Hartog Ridge. Sampling in the Perth Abyssal Plain region will help to resolve uncertainties regarding the early spreading history and the full-fit of the India-Australia-Antarctica triple plate system. This objective relates primarily to Joanne Whittaker, Dietmar Müller and Simon Williams.

Scientific Objectives: 
Project 1: PI: Prof. Patrick De Deckker
This project will generate high-resolution records of sea-surface temperature [SST]
changes that have occurred offshore southern Australlia over the last two millennia.
A variety of innovative proxies will be employed and used for comparison with
lake records on land. International collaboration is a feature of this program, linking
with the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research [NIOZ] to determine past
sea-surface temperatures and wind-induced upwelling conditions using specific
organic compounds recovered in deep-sea cores, and with the marine radio-isotope
laboratory in Bordeaux, France, to accurately date cores over short time scales.
Project 2: PI: Dr Rudy Kloser
Spatial management is becoming increasingly common and Australia leads the world
in developing a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA)
by 2012. However, the NRSMPA by itself will not be adequate to manage and protect
the marine environment and spatial management of areas outside the NRSMPA will
be required. This places an increased demand on scientists to know the physical
structure of those areas and their value to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Extracted from Voyage plan please read plan for full description.</skos:definition>

XBT/CTD intercomparisons. 
Scientific Objectives
XBT/CTD intercomparison (Rebecca Cowley):
We propose a simple and reliable experiment to assess the fall-rate and
temperature biases of modern XBTs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Sippican
(the major global supplier). We aim to collect concurrent temperature profiles
form both XBT systems and high accuracy CTD systems. We have some old
XBT probes which we would like to deploy to compare with modern probes.
We plan to address the questions:
1. Do modern XBTs have temperature and depth biases?
2. Do older XBTs (circa 2001-2003) show similar temperature
and depth biases to those found in previous work?
3. Can we use depth soundings to check depth accuracy, and how do these
results compare with the CTD/XBT intercomparison method?
Piggy-back Projects
Rudy Kloser (CMAR)
Rudy's project is SWATH mapping of the 200m to 1000m depth
range, particularly along the northern edge of Bass Canyon.
Julia Reisser (PhD student, CMAR)
Julia's project is looking at the sources, distribution and fate of marine debris. Sampling several times per day using a neuston net. 
Clare Murphy (UoW)
Clare's project is looking at transect measurements of greenhouse gases in the
marine atmosphere. (Extract from the voyage plan, please see plan for full details.)</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: MNF Southern Surveyor RV ss2012_t03. Predicting the sources, distribution and fate of floating marine debris. Scientific Objectives: Marine debris has become a major hazard to marine life through ingestion and entanglement and is also leading to aesthetic degradation, economic losses and human health hazards. The increase in amounts of marine debris can be attributed to at least three factors: (1) plastics replaced natural fibers in the manufacture of many everyday items; (2) plastics are often less expensive than the materials they replace,thereby decreasing incentives to reuse or recycle items; (3) there are simply more ships and coastal residents that can lose or discard materials. Monitoring studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of governments' actions in reducing the overall amount of marine debris as well as certain types of debris of particular concern, such as fishing gear and microplastics. For the first time, floating marine debris (FMD) will be systematically sampled in oceanic waters close to east coast of Australia. This voyage will provide us the opportunity to collect samples over a broad range of latitudes. These data will be useful to test a hypothesis recently proposed by marine researchers: FMD concentrations tend to be higher at subtropical latitudes. The general aim of this project is to estimate FMD composition and concentration (pieces/km2) at different locations around Australia.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): Investigator Voyage IN2015_V02 Title: Sustained monitoring of the East Australian Current: Mass, heat and freshwater transports.

Scientific objectives
The East Australian Current (EAC) is a complex and highly energetic western boundary system in the south-western Pacific off eastern Australia. It provides both the western boundary of the South Pacific gyre and the linking element between the Pacific and Indian Ocean gyres. This voyage will deploy an array of full-depth current meter and property (CTD) moorings from the continental slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (27o S). At this location the EAC, north of the high eddy variability, the EAC approaches its maximum strength and its flow is relatively uniform and coherent. The aim of this observing system is to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC. This is a component of IMOS, and will provide an intensive reference set of measurements of the EAC flow over sustained period for monitoring EAC transport, improved understanding of relationship of EAC and the South Pacific gyre and impact of the coastal marine ecosystem, and validation and interpretation of the current system in numerous climate and ocean models. The mooring array is located on the existing long-term XBT transects, satellite altimetry and glider tracks. The EAC deep mooring array will be complemented by a Queensland- IMOS operated inshore mooring array on the continental shelf region.

Voyage objectives
This voyage will redeploy an array of six full-depth current meter and property (temperature, salinity and pressure) moorings from the continental slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (26o S). The observing system is designed to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC. In order to resolve interannual and decadal signals we aim to maintain a multi-year deployment of the array. The main aim of the voyage will be to deploy an array of (6) full-depth current meter/CTD moorings extending from the continental slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane. The following specific objectives will be performed:

List of tasks
1. Carry out swath mapping from the abyssal plain to the base of the continental slope
2. Deploy each of the moorings at appropriate locations, including position triangulation of each mooring
3. Complete CTD/rosette stations at each mooring, with LADCP
4. Complete a number of Ship ADCP sections along the mooring line
5. Complete deep CTD and RBR sensor testing at a number of CTD stations
6. Complete XBT and CTD side-by-side comparisons at CTD stations

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Southern Surveyor SS2012_V07. Tasmantid Seamounts: volcanic, tectonic, and carbonate record. 
Scientific Objectives :
The Tasmantid seamounts are a chain of underwater hotspot-derived intraplate volcanoes situated 150 to 600 km east of the Australian mainland (Figure 1). Because of the long record of hotspot-derived volcanic activity - spanning more than 2000 km and &gt;40 million years - the seamounts provide an exceptional and largely untapped record of Australian plate velocity. Deciphering this record by obtaining volcanic samples suitable for high-resolution 40Ar/39Ar geochronology is a major objective of this expedition (Cohen, Vasconcelos, Knesel). Such volcanic samples will also record the chemical evolution of a long-lived mantle plume, and chemical analyses will reveal information on mantle reservoirs, melting, magma diversification, and the contrasting contamination effects of thinned continental lithosphere in the north versus oceanic lithosphere in the south (Knesel, Arculus). Geophysical data will also be collected over the seamounts and oceanic crust of the Tasman Sea to help study the tectonic history and lithospheric structure of the region. The larger seamounts are variably capped by fossil and modern coral reefs and/or other carbonate sediments (Webb). Although not targeted specifically, where carbonate materials are recovered with the volcanic rocks this material will provide a key biologic and climatic record of the seas east of Australia. Morphologic analysis of the seamounts will allow identification of volcanic and coral-growth geomorphology, as well as any mass wasting deposits (Cohen, Webb).</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator Research Charter Voyage in2015_c01. GAB deep water geological and benthic ecology program. 
Scientific objectives:
The Great Australian Bight (GAB) represents one of Australia's most prospective frontier hydrocarbon exploration regions. However, the primary Ceduna sedimentary sub-basin - the focus of our work - is characterised by a paucity of data on its deep water geology and almost no knowledge of its benthic biological communities.
The Ceduna sub-basin is the product of rifting followed by the subsequent Southern Ocean seafloor spreading between Australia and Antarctica. The rifting created a narrow seaway between Australia and Antarctica, which was initially filled by two large deltaic super sequences (represented by the Tiger and Hammerhead super sequences respectively). Decreased sediment supply followed this period, during which commencement of fast seafloor spreading led to the initiation of widespread igneous activity and the development of a large number of volcanoes across the basin. Subsequent low sedimentation rates combined with continued subsidence have created the current modern deep water Ceduna sub-basin geomorphology. Key knowledge gaps in the understanding of the fundamental geology of the Ceduna sub-basin include:
1. Sedimentary facies and source rocks.
2. Hydrocarbon seeps.
3. Mid-Eocene Volcanic activity.
4. Basin and benthic biodiversity and distribution.

The voyage objectives are built around three main survey targets:
* Outcrops of sedimentary rocks - to collect samples for sedimentary facies and source rock analysis
* Potential areas of seepage - to determine if hydrocarbon seepage can be identified
* Deepwater seamounts - to identify, sample and investigate the nature of the mid-Eocene volcanics.

The trials of individual gears will commence with simple deployments in relative shallow and accessible (sediment) benthic habitats but will progressively target deeper and more challenging habitats as gear performance and safe-handling processes are established. We anticipate that each gear will be deployed several times.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: MNF Southern Surveyor research voyage SS2012_v05. IMOS: Sustained observations of the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait components of the Indonesian Throughflow.
Scientific Objectives: The Indonesian seas are the only major low-latitude connection in the global oceans (Figure 1). This connection permits the transfer of Pacific waters into the Indian Ocean, known as the Indonesian Throughflow. The Indonesian Throughflow actually consists of several filaments of flow that occupy different depth levels and weave their way through the complex island geometry comprised of broad shallow shelves and deep basins. The largest Indonesian seas are: the shallow Java Sea, the deeper Flores, Banda and Timor Seas, and the shallow Arafura Sea.

The Indonesian Throughflow has a major influence on both the climate of the Indian Ocean and the global oceans. It is an important pathway for the transfer of climate signals and their anomalies around the world's oceans. While the heat and fresh water carried by the Indonesian Throughflow  are known to affect the basin budgets of both the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the Indonesian Throughflow is poorly simulated in ocean circulation, seasonal prediction and climate models. 

Given the importance of the Indonesian Throughflow to the Australian climate IMOS supported the long-term monitoring of the two major pathways of the throughflow - namely the Timor Passage and Ombai Strait. The first 18-month deployment of the moorings array was completed in June 2011. This voyage will recover and redeploy these moorings for a further 18 month period.

1) Epibenthic communities of northern Australia (Belinda Alvarez de Glasby(MAGNT)). 
2) An examination of the microbial oceanography of north-eastern Australia (Martina Doblin (UTS).
Scientific Objectives (1)
1.	To use a remotely operated underwater video camera (ROV) to explore two areas along the transit voyage track of RV Southern Surveyor from Darwin to Cairns for discovery of habitat-forming and bioactive epibenthic fauna. 
2.	To collect epibenthic fauna using a sled thereby ground-truthing the video data. 
3.	To sort, photograph, document and prepare taxonomic vouchers of the samples captured with the benthic sled.
4.	To deposit taxonomic vouchers of all samples at MAGNT for curation, registration and distribution to the appropriate taxonomic experts for taxonomic identification. 
5.	To prepare and freeze suitable samples for screening of bioactive compounds and accession them at the AIMS Bioresources library for future export to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) laboratories or for research on marine natural products. 
6.	To correlate biodiversity measure obtained from the survey with available physical datasets from GA (e.g. geomorphology, sediment grain-size).
Scientific Objectives (2)
The major biotic players in controlling the function of the global ocean are microorganisms. To fully understand the basic biological and chemical dynamics of ocean ecosystems, the identity and role of the microbial assemblages inhabiting seawater must be accurately defined. The proposed research will provide an important new platform for understanding the ecology and biogeochemistry of this region.

The specific objectives of the proposed research are to:

1.	Provide a first characterisation of the taxonomy, diversity and biogeography of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms inhabiting Australia's NE ocean waters;
2.	Assess the physiological and biogeochemical potential of the microbial communities inhabiting this region;
3.	Characterise the light climate to define optical niches for growth of marine primary producers and undertake manipulative experiments to examine optical regulation of carbon fixation; 
4.	Characterise the eco-physiology and fine-scale community structure of abundant microbial primary producers, including Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and photosynthetic pico-eukaryotes;
5.	Establish and test new microbial oceanography experimentation protocols, while also providing valuable training to students and early career researchers in oceanographic research practices.

1. The nature of the crust (continental/volcanic/oceanic) underlying Rennell Island, East Rennell Island Ridge, South Rennell Fracture Zone and d'Entrecasteaux Zone by directly sampling and comparing the basement from each of these submarine plateaus and ridges. This objective relates primarily to Sebastein Meffre, Steven Micklethwaite, Julien Collot and Maria Seton.
2. The age and structure of the Santa Cruz/Torres and d'Entrecasteaux Basins
through magnetic profiling and explore whether they share a spatial and temporal
relationship. We will also explore whether the basins formed in a back-arc
setting related to Cretaceous or Eocene subduction or whether they preserve
a piece of oceanic crust from the Panthalassa Ocean. This objective relates
primarily to Maria Seton, Dietmar Muller, Christian Heine and Julien Collot.
3. The extension of the Lord Howe hotspot trail into the eastern Coral Sea, north of the Bellona Plateau by directly sampling extinct volcanic edifices and exploring whether the West Torres Plateau is capped by volcanics.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Southern Surveyor: Southern Surveyor SS2013_V01. Submarine landslides offshore northern New South Wales and southern Queensland: their geomechanical characteristics, timing and triggers. Scientific Objectives: An extensive region of the continental slope located offshore Northern NSW and Southern Queensland between Byron Bay and the southern tip of Fraser was demonstrated to have experienced intense submarine erosion dominated by submarine landsliding in 2008 (SS 12/2008, Boyd, Keene, Gardner, Exon, Hubble et al). Major questions about the geographic extent of the area affected by these processes, the geomechanics and dynamics of sliding; the timing and frequency of sliding; and the potential trigger mechanism for slide initiation have arisen from the analysis of the material collected by the scientists who participated in the SS12/2008 voyage. These workers and their colleagues (Hubble, Airey, Clarke, Yu, Keene, Boyd et al) demonstrated that submarine landsliding on Eastern Australia's continental margin is unexpectedly young and frequent at geological timescales. They have also developed geological and geotechnical models which attempt to explain the apparent
youth and unexpected frequency of submarine landsliding in this area of the eastern Australian continental margin.
This project will extend the findings of the SS 12/2008 work by collecting data that will help to validate or modify the models developed to explain the areas submarine erosion and landsliding. This will be achieved by collecting additional core and dredge samples in the original study area and by extending the coverage of detailed bathymetric to the north of the 2008 study area; and by sampling appropriate features in the area identified in the area where this new bathymetric mapping of the outer shelf and slope will be undertaken.</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): The voyage objectives are built around three main scientific objectives:
* The benthic characterisation and sampling outcropping sedimentary rocks to aid understanding of modern seabed erosional mechanisms, sedimentary processes and paleoenvironmental reconstruction.
* Benthic characterisation and sampling in areas of potential seepage to determine if fluid escape is occurring and the nature of the fluids and their relationship to the benthic fauna in these areas.
* Sampling of benthic fauna over a large geographic area to establish deep water community structure and function and augment understandings gained from recent IN2015_C01 and IN2015_C02 voyages.

Benthic characterisation of outcrop rocks and sampling of benthic fauna carry higher weight than that of the seep characterisation. The voyage plan includes more planned operations in each target area than can be achieved within the time allocations for the survey. Each of these target areas are ranked based on their importance in delivering on the scientific objectives.

The survey will use a hierarchical design comprising seafloor mapping prior to seafloor sampling and limited water column characterisation.

Seafloor mapping and water column characterisation
1. Hull mounted acoustic characterisation of the water column and seafloor over the target areas of interest. This activity will comprise the use of MBES, water column acoustic backscatter, single beam echo sounder, sub-bottom profiler and ADCP to determine processes occurring in the water column and map the seafloor and shallow subsurface geology.
2. Seafloor characterisation from the surface will be complemented with a limited number of tow camera to obtain video transects across the target area seafloor and overlying near bottom waters.

Seafloor and water column sampling
A number of sampling operations will be undertaken to describe the seafloor geology and benthic biota. Each sampling operation will differ dependant on sampling target, primarily based on substrate composition. For the soft substrate targets there will be a focus on grab samples whilst for the harder substrate types the focus will be on dredging. Sampling will be by:
1. Deployment of grab sampler to sample the surface sediment infauna, microbiology, hydrocarbon chemistry and physical properties.
2. Use of a beam trawl or Sherman sled to collect samples of benthic macro fauna over target areas.
3. Use of rock dredges to collects lithified sediments for description and detailed chemical analysis.
4. Limited collections of water column profile data including CTD, chemical sensor readings and associated water samples</skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): Frontal eddies or "billows" are ubiquitous, small cyclonic eddies &lt;100 km in diameter, and regularly characterise the continental side of all ocean boundary currents. They occur approximately weekly, and last up to 3 weeks which is sufficient for the early life history of fish. The physics and biology of these ubiquitous eddies are not understood. They are not resolved by present-day surface altimetry, but are evident along the East Australian Current (EAC) in SST or in real-time surface currents from the Coffs Harbour HF Radar (30.5°S). We will determine if uplift within the eddy nurtures plankton in comparison to the inner shelf water; and in comparison to similar eddies
offshore around the EAC retroflection. We expect entrainment of adjacent shelf water is preconditioned to sustain larval fish, compared to entrainment of Tasman Sea water. We expect the condition and size distribution (survival) of larval fish will be greater in frontal eddies than in source water on the shelf or in the EAC. Frontal eddies may be a general mechanism for recruitment to coastal fisheries, such as for the Kuroshio Current, Gulf Stream, Agulhas Current.

We will continue our long-term observations of phytoplankton, salps, krill, larval fish assemblages and eddy behaviour in this important region. We will investigate 2 to 3 frontal eddies on 2 separate occasions in the following possible locations:

* the EAC separation zone south of North Stradbroke Island (27.6°S); or
* south of Cape Byron (28.6°S);
* south of Smoky Cape (30.9°S),
* under the Coffs Harbour HF radar (30°S)
* south of Seal Rocks/Sugarloaf Point (32.4°S) and off Port Stephens (32.7°S) or Sydney (34°S).

Our scientific objectives are to:
1. Examine the entrainment shelf water and the amount of eddy uplift driven in relation to the strength of the adjacent EAC, coastal wind, the coastal counter-current, and slope canyons; and to quantify oceanographic behaviour of frontal eddies including their movement; 
2. Compare the zooplankton size structure and the bioacoustic biomass between coastal waters, frontal eddies and the adjacent EAC or Tasman Sea;
3. Similarly compare the phytoplankton (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) biomass, diversity of pigments and other molecular markers and biogeochemical functions across coastal, EAC and frontal eddy water masses,
4. Similarly compare the zooplankton size structure and species diversity, the larval fish size distribution and the bioacoustic biomass;
5. The abundance, condition and genetic traits of other zooplankton (lobster phyllosoma).

IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series(SOTS) Automated Moorings for Climate and Carbon Cycle Studies Southwest Of Tasmania.

Scientific objectives: The Southern Ocean has a predominant role in the movement of heat and carbon dioxide into the ocean interior moderating Earth's average surface climate. SOTS uses a set of three automated mooring to measure these processes under extreme conditions, where they are most intense and have been least studied.  The atmosphere-ocean exchanges occur on many timescales, from daily insolation cycles to ocean basin decadal oscillations and thus high frequency observations sustained over many years are required.  The current context of anthropogenic forcing of rapid climate change adds urgency to the work.

Voyage objectives: The primary objective is to deploy a full set of SOTS moorings (SOFS, Pulse, and SAZ) and to obtain ancillary information of the oceanographic conditions at the time of deployment using CTD casts, underway measurements, the Triaxus towed body, and deployment of autonomous profiling Bio-Argo floats.
Each of the SOTS moorings delivers to specific aspects of the atmosphere-ocean exchanges, with some redundancy:
i)   the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) focuses on air properties, ocean stratification, waves, and currents.
ii)  the Pulse biogeochemistry mooring focuses on processes important to biological CO2 consumption, including net community production from oxygen measurements and nitrate depletion, biomass concentrations from bio-optics and bio-acoustics, and collection of water samples for nutrient and plankton quantification.  
iii) the SAZ sediment trap mooring focuses on quantifying the transfer of carbon and other nutrients to the ocean interior by sinking particles, and collecting samples to investigate their ecological controls.
Additional water sampling and sensor comparisons against shipboard systems provide quality control and spatial context, which is further augmented by Bio-Argo float and Triaxus towed body deployments, and satellite remote sensing. Please read voyage plan for full description.</skos:definition>

Voyage objectives: The primary objective is to deploy a full set of SOTS moorings (SOFS, Pulse, and SAZ) and to obtain ancillary information of the oceanographic conditions at the time of deployment using CTD casts, underway measurements, the Triaxus towed body, and deployment of autonomous profiling Bio-Argo floats.
Each of the SOTS moorings delivers to specific aspects of the atmosphere-ocean exchanges, with some redundancy:
i)   the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) focuses on air properties, ocean stratification, waves, and currents.
ii)  the Pulse biogeochemistry mooring focuses on processes important to biological CO2 consumption, including net community production from oxygen measurements and nitrate depletion, biomass concentrations from bio-optics and bio-acoustics, and collection of water samples for nutrient and plankton quantification.  
iii) the SAZ sediment trap mooring focuses on quantifying the transfer of carbon and other nutrients to the ocean interior by sinking particles, and collecting samples to investigate their ecological controls.
Additional water sampling and sensor comparisons against shipboard systems provide quality control and spatial context, which is further augmented by Bio-Argo float and Triaxus towed body deployments, and satellite remote sensing. Please read voyage plan for full description.</skos:scopeNote>

The debris field of the HMAS Australia wreck has never been adequately explored. This work will explore the extent of the debris field from the wreck, including the location of loose guns (rifled cannons) and funnels which were stored on deck, along with the location of  the gun turrets which would have fallen out of their mounts during the sinking.

Scientific Objectives:
The project aims to improve our understanding of the sources, sinks and background concentrations of key greenhouse gases in the Southern Hemisphere.

Scientific Objectives:
The overall scientific objective is to obtain frequent measurements of surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean, and then onwards to the ocean interior in the form of sinking particles. This "biological pump" drives carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and writes the sedimentary record.  The controls on its intensity are complex and involve processes that vary on daily, weekly, seasonal, and inter-annual timescales.  Obtaining observations with the necessary frequency is not possible from ships.  For this reason the IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series Facility seeks to obtain this information using automated sensor measurements and sample collections.

Scientific Objectives: Our work will include a suite of CTD, microstructure, surface drifter and float observations,and a mooring that will contribute to answering a first-order gap in our understanding of the large-scale currents in the subtropical southeast Indian Ocean. The presence of a near-surface, eastward flow across the South Indian Ocean is a remarkable aspect of the upper-ocean circulation because it flows against the westward direction from Ekman and Sverdrup theory for this region. The flow often appears as a set of distinct currents and jets. These currents have been detected in observations and simulated in some numerical models. However the underlying mechanisms driving the eastward surface currents and their eventual interaction with the Leeuwin Current and downwelling against the coast remains unclear. Furthermore, they appear to be linked to the Indonesian Throughflow and
Southern Ocean water masses formed south of Australia. Our primary goal in this work is to make new observations of the physical and biogeochemical structure of the eastward flows in the region between
existing observations and the Australian coast, where their fate is unknown. This region is filled with energetic eddies generated by the Leeuwin Current. Our observations will also provide insight into the nature of the interaction of these eddies with the circulation and productivity of the interior Indian
Ocean. Dynamical understanding of the Indian Ocean circulation is central to the outstanding problem in ocean climate projections of correctly including surface processes to project the spatial patterns of heat uptake, steric sea-level rise, and storage of carbon dioxide.</skos:definition>

Indonesian Throughflow Mooring Recovery and Deployments: Timor
Passage and Ombai Strait. 

Scientific Objectives: 
The aim of IMOS Indonesian Throughflow moorings is to sustainably and directly measure the leakage of Pacific thermocline and intermediate waters from the western equatorial Pacific into the South Indian Ocean in the two major passages: Timor Passage and Ombai Strait. 
The Indonesian Passages represent an important "choke point" of the global ocean overturning circulation and the climate system. The interannual to decadal variability of the size and depth distribution of the flow through this choke point remains a troublesome unknown. In particular, changes in this flow will reflect long term changes in the Pacific and Indian Ocean wind fields, particularly any change in the Walker Circulation, as predicted by coupled climate models forced by increasing Greenhouse Gas scenarios. Changes in the associated heat flux are also anticipated as the global oceans warm. 

The IMOS Indonesian Throughflow array design is based on the more comprehensive INSTANT process study and is deemed the minimal required mooring array to monitor the Indonesian Throughflow. The Ombai Strait and Timor Passage Throughflow components comprise about 11 Sv of the 14 Sv total interbasin exchange. This mooring array integrates with the AIMS NAOS shelf line, allowing estimates of the interbasin exchange to include the transport of very warm waters across the Australian North West Shelf. All moorings in the Timor Passage are located along a high precision swath line of the TOPEX/Jason satellite altimeter missions. These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data
assimilating models.</skos:definition>

These data will shed light on how best to exploit altimetric data over our shallow northern shelves, especially in data
assimilating models.</skos:scopeNote>

Scientific Objectives:
Study of benthic ecosystems and natural hydrocarbon seepage in deep (200-3,000 m) waters of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) are part of the focus of a research program (the GAB Science Plan).  The Science Plan aims to describe key elements of marine ecosystems across the GAB, including in the deep central GAB area associated with oil and gas exploration activity.  Characterising benthic ecosystem structure and function is important because there are virtually no existing benthic biological data beyond continental shelf depths (&lt; 200 m) in the GAB.  Conservation values attributed to Commonwealth Marine Reserves (CMR) spanning wide depth ranges are untested on the mid- and lower continental slope, while oil and gas lease areas extend across the GAB Marine Park (GAB MP). The benthic ecosystem description will be strengthened with context provided by an improved understanding of hydrocarbon seeps and migration pathways in the GAB.  
The objectives of several projects within the Science Plan will be partly met by results from this voyage.</skos:definition>

Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Facility 3. Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) moorings for climate and carbon cycle studies southwest of Tasmania (47ºS, 140ºE). 
Scientific Objectives 
The overall scientific objective is to obtain frequent measurements of surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean, and then onwards to the ocean interior in the form of sinking particles. This "biological pump" drives carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and writes the sedimentary record. The controls on its intensity are complex and involve processes that vary on daily, weekly, seasonal, and inter-annual timescales. Obtaining observations with the necessary frequency is not possible from ships. For this reason the IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series Facility seeks to obtain this information using automated sensor measurements and sample collections. 
This voyage will carry out the annual servicing of SOTS moorings, along with a limited set of ancillary underway and on-station water column observations. The moorings to be deployed are: 
	SOFS-4 mooring to make meteorological and upper ocean measurements of physical and chemical properties important to air-sea exchange of heat, water, momentum, and dissolved gases (oxygen and CO2). 
	Pulse-10 mooring to make upper ocean measurements of properties that control carbon uptake and export to the ocean interior, including temperature, salinity, mixed layer depth, light, oxygen, total dissolved gases, phytoplankton fluorescence, particle backscatter, and dissolved nitrate, and collect 24 paired water samples later study of nutrients and phytoplankton identification. 
	SAZ-16 mooring to collect sediment trap samples in the deep sea (below 1000m) to quantify the transfer of particulate carbon and other materials to the ocean interior. 

The moorings to be recovered are: 
	Pulse-9 mooring 
	SOFS-3 mooring (bottom half only - top recovered in 2012 after it broke loose) 
	(SAZ-15 mooring will not be recovered, and will remain in the ocean until recovery in 2014) 

Ancillary measurements to be carried out include swath mapping, underway and CTD sensor and sample collections, zooplankton net sampling, towing of a continuous plankton recorder, launch of Argo floats, and a piggy-back project to calibrate ship acoustic sensors.</skos:definition>

The benthic fauna of the Great Australian Bight 
Scientific Objectives: 
The focus of this program is to give students a taste of what it is like to live and work on an ocean going research vessel and to expose them to some of the different sampling methods and equipment that are used in oceanographic research. The students will have three quasi scientific aims as follows: 1) to sample and characterise the benthic communities in the Great Australian Bight (GAB); 2) to investigate surface and water column productivity along Australia's southern seaboard; 3) to map Australia's seafloor.  The students will be involved in all aspects of the research - sorting and curating the fauna - milking the rosette/changing the filters and measuring the dissolved oxygen and salinity - operating and monitoring the swath. Outside of sampling stations and designated tasks, students will take it in turns to watch for marine mammals and we may supplement the sampling and research with a series of lectures and practicals utilising the material/data collected.

For Keith, the voyage provides an ongoing opportunity to use vessel transit time to complete a national mapping of the upper-mid slope seabed with multi-beam mapping and associated ecological interpretation. The upper-slope and mid-slope seabed 100 m to 1500 m depth range, are regions important for regional marine planning, biodiversity and conservation assessments and fisheries habitat mapping. The swath mapping will be integrated as a part of the student activities and there is a 12h portion of the transit dedicated to targeting some canyons off Esperance and filling the swath track adjacent to the 500 m isobath.

For Tanner &amp; Williams the voyage provides an opportunity to gain further specimens and add a temporal aspect to their study of the epifaunal assemblages (benthic) of the GAB Marine Park and its surrounds. The GAB is a unique ecosystem, with diversity similar to the Great Barrier Reef, and a much higher proportion of endemic species, but only a fraction of the scientific effort.</skos:definition>

The students will have two (quasi) scientific aims, all of which will contribute to our knowledge about Australian waters, as follows: 1) to characterise the macro-fauna inhabiting the benthos at range of deep water (~500 m) sites along Australia's southern coast; 2) to investigate regional surface productivity (POM) along the southern shelf of Australia.

For Kloser, the voyage provides an ongoing opportunity to use vessel transit time to complete a national mapping of the upper-mid slope seabed with multi-beam mapping and associated ecological interpretation. The upper-slope and mid-slope seabed 100 m to 1500 m depth range, are regions important for regional marine planning, biodiversity and conservation assessments and fisheries habitat mapping.

1.What is the density of marine debris in the oceanic regions around Australia?
2.What is the composition of marine debris in the regions sampled?
3.What fraction is anthropogenic in origin?
We also hope to evaluate the use of an aerostat as a tool for collecting low level aerial images from behind the vessel.  However this is conditional on further development of the appropriate camera with our technological collaborator.
Plankton Surveys (Dave McLeod, CMAR) 
To collect plankton using a CPR along a transect between Broome and Darwin to improve our understanding of plankton abundance and distribution in the north west area of Australia.
Measurements of Nitrogen Fixation (Eric Raes, UWA)
Collect physical and biological data using the ship's conductivity - temperature - depth profiler from the surface and the oxygen minimum feature in the photic zone at stations between Broome and Darwin, particularly targeting eddies where possible.</skos:definition>

Voyage Objectives: This voyage will trial the vessels acoustic and pelagic ecosystem sampling capabilities. In particular the capability to deploy new acoustic and optical sampling technologies safely and to be able to carry out diel 24 hr sampling stations deploying a variety of sampling platforms. This will require the vessels operations to switch from gear types within a 12 hour cycle of CTD, net systems and lowered acoustic and optical technologies. To ensure a realistic simulation of procedures and processing of samples, work flows will be tested assuming collection of quality data sets. To safely work up towards full operational status, trials of equipment and procedures will be carried out in shallow water and once safe procedures and techniques have been established move to deeper water. Sampling to 2500 m will be attempted to trial net, CTD, acoustic, optical equipment capability. This will be targeted to a site of suspected elevated production.

The vessels low noise capability will be tested and a reference noise signature obtained close to port to enable regular checks to be done in the future. The pelagic acoustic systems on the vessel will be calibrated and operated to ensure they can contribute to the IMOS bioacoustics facility. New acoustic systems on board will be operated and tested. 
Science Equipment and Operations:
Develop and implement procedures and JHAs for scientific operations for the following:
	Calibration of Simrad EK60 and ME70 acoustic echosounders
	Noise ranging of the vessel
	Trials and deployments of the MIDOC, IKMT, EZ net systems
	Trials and deployment of DECAF and a profiling Acoustic Optical System
	Undertake two 24 hr stations to characterise the plankton to micronekton with acoustic, optical and biological sampling - includes CTD, Triaxis LOPC, drop net, side net, AOS, MIDOC, IKMT and EZ net systems.
	Investigate the deep water sampling capability to 2500 m for elevated production - CTD, EZ net, IKMT and Deep video.
	Trials of the Simrad ME70 and the multi-frequency classification of pelagic habitat using EK sounders and sub-bottom profiler
Collect and process data and samples as for a research voyage to test laboratories, facilities and on board systems:
	Operation of wetlabs to process catches from plankton to micronekton with freeze and preservation capabilities (formaldehyde and alcohol) 
	Photographic recordings including Kreisel tank.

Scientific Objectives

This research aims to determine the extent and composition of carbonate environments on and around volcanic edifices in the northern Tasman Sea. We plan to undertake the following investigations, listed in order of priority:
1.	Examine the bathymetry and sedimentary environments across the shelf around Balls Pyramid, the remnant of a volcanic island just south of Lord Howe Island, from which such data are presently lacking; this will provide a basis for a more complete mapping of benthic habitats in the Lord Howe Marine Park.
2.	Establish, using underwater towed video, whether a relict reef exists on the Balls Pyramid platform; this will confirm preliminary evidence that there may be a feature similar to the fossil reef on the shelf around Lord Howe, and would make it the southernmost known reef in the Pacific. Extend towed video to map major habitats of the Lord Howe Island Marine Park.
3.	Extract rock cores from the Lord Howe relict reef (and that on the Balls platform, if found) providing material for component, age and geochemical determinations that will yield further insights into sea-level and climate (including palaeotemperature) history.
4.	Collect vibrocores from the inner shelf on the Lord Howe shelf (and on the Balls platform if suitable areas are identified), in the lee of the relict reef, to determine the stratigraphy, source and depositional history of sequences of sediment revealed on Topas sub-bottom profiles and which appear to contain generations of 'lagoonal' sediment perhaps indicating that earlier reef features predated, and may underlie, the relict reef.
5.	Undertake preliminary bathymetry transects and Topas sub-bottom profiles across the margin of Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs on the transit voyage to Lord Howe Island as a pilot study to better plan further data collection around these reefs in 2014.
6.	Determine whether terraces identified on the shelf edge contain evidence of earlier episodes of reef development or are cut into basalt; this will provide evidence of sea level, clarifying the nature of the shoreline when the sea was at these heights (60-70m water depth), and would extend known distribution of pre-Holocene reef if shown to be biogenic features.
7.	Examine slump features around both volcanic edifices to clarify their extent, and the nature and composition of sediment that covers them; this will clarify the post-eruptive history of the volcanic islands, and show the degree to which carbonate sediment from the shelf or hemipelagic sediment veneers their margins.
8.	Resolve the morphology of the toe of the volcanoes, and collect mulitbeam sonar data on one or more of the small seamounts that have been detected adjacent to the Lord Howe volcano; this will clarify the nature of sediments and sedimentary deposits at the toe, and provide insights into the origin and benthic habitats of previously unknown seamounts.
9.	Deploy sea-surface drifters to track ocean currents along the eastern margin of Australia. Drifters are expendable (not recovered) and can be deployed while underway.</skos:definition>

[1] Seafloor and subseafloor mapping/geophysical characterisation.
Continuous mapping will be carried out using the multibeam systems, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders, sub-bottom profiler, gravimeter, and (on long transits between ports and the study area) magnetometer to characterise bathymetric features and identify those most likely to include volcanic or hydrothermal activity. XBT or CTD data will be acquired at standard intervals for sound velocity corrections to the multibeam data. The data will be initially processed at sea to inform site selection for volcanic and hydrothermal sampling.
[2] Nature of submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal systems. 
We will characterise the spatial distribution, morphology, and geology of active submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal systems. [Extract only]
[3] Detecting hydrothermal inputs to the ocean, and vertical water movements that deliver them to surface waters.
full-depth CTD/LADCP/TMR transects will be performed to capture cross-shore gradients in water. [Extract only]
[4] Detecting impacts on surface phytoplankton production.
During the underway mapping we will continuously operate sensors to measure biological activity (fluorescence for phytoplankton abundance, fast-repetition-rate fluorescence for phytoplankton photosynthetic competence, transmission for total carbon biomass, and O2/Ar ratio mass spectrometry for net community production). The sensors will be augmented by underway sampling for phytoplankton pigments, particulate organic and inorganic carbon, biogenic silica, heterotrophic bacterial responses, and microscopic phytoplankton identification to characterise community structures, and 15N measurements to identify the extent of nitrate versus ammonium metabolism - a key indicator of ecosystem Fe stimulation capable of additional carbon sequestration. Above and downstream of active hydrothermal systems, we will obtain samples for further analyses ashore. We also intend to carry out deckboard micro-nutrient enrichment incubation experiments to ascertain the biological response of hydrothermal iron to surface phytoplankton communities. Deployment of a bio-optical sensor package after each CTD deployment will provide measurements to link these communities to satellite images.
[5] Ocean circulation around Heard Island and across the eastern Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean.
The shipboard ADCP and all available underway systems (thermosalinograph, meteorology, and biogeochemical systems) will be run at all times. We will seek contributions of autonomous instruments to deploy on the voyage to provide more detailed sampling of the circulation. We have contacted the Global Surface Drifter Program run by NOAA, and the Australian office of the International Argo Program. The lowered ADCP will be used at every CTD station to measure full water column velocity. New processing methods also allow the detection of internal waves and mixing using a shear-strain parameterisation, even in shallow waters. [Extract only]
 [6] Microbial response and bacterial processes
What is the response of the microbial community to iron and organic carbon availability in different zones of the Southern Ocean, with focus on the possible impact of hydrothermal activity. More specific question: How does iron and carbon limitation affect heterotrophic bacterial respiration and growth efficiency, and its diversity?

Observations of remarkable eastward flows and eddies in the subtropical southeast Indian Ocean. Scientific Objectives: Our work will include a suite of CTD, microstructure, surface drifter and float observations, and a mooring that will contribute to answering a first-order gap in our understanding of the large-scale currents in the subtropical southeast Indian Ocean. The presence of a near-surface, eastward flow across the South Indian Ocean is a remarkable aspect of the upper-ocean circulation because it flows against the westward direction from Ekman and Sverdrup theory for this region. However the underlying mechanisms, driving the eastward surface currents and their eventual interaction with the Leeuwin Current and down welling remains unclear. Our primary goal in this work is to make new observations of the physical and biogeochemical structure of the eastward flows in the region between existing observations and the Australian coast, where their fate is unknown. This region is filled with energetic eddies generated by the Leeuwin Current. Our observations will also provide insight into the nature of the interaction of these eddies with the circulation and productivity of the interior Indian Ocean. Dynamical understanding of the Indian Ocean circulation is central to the outstanding problem in ocean climate projections of correctly including surface processes to project the spatial patterns of heat uptake, steric sea-level rise, and storage of carbon dioxide. Piggy-back Projects include : Upper-ocean mixing estimates using a VMP-200 microstructure profiler, Nitrogen uptake in the eastward flows feeding the Leeuwin Current System, Phytoplankton dynamics in the eastward flows feeding the Leeuwin Current System and  Offshore sources of high nitrate, low oxygen upper ocean waters.

1) Dredge volcanic and sedimentary rocks to obtain new, rigorous age and paleo-depth constraints for the Cascade Seamount. Underway bathymetric data will be used to refine dredge targets. 

2) Collect sediment cores across a depth transect to enable work investigating paleo-oceanographic conditions using proxies. Preferably at least a multicore proximal to IODP site 1172, and piston cores at the mid- and shallow-depth sites.

3) Collect high resolution swath bathymetry and sub-bottom profile data to see how far recent sediment flows extend from the Cascade Seamount towards IODP site 1172, to test the hypothesis that downslope transport resulted in the observed sediment patterns in core 1172. Existing coverage and resolution of bathymetry across the East Tasman Plateau is insufficient to resolve this question.

      <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Gear Trials: IN2016_E01: Investigator (RV): Scientific Objectives:

1) Dredge volcanic and sedimentary rocks to obtain new, rigorous age and paleo-depth constraints for the Cascade Seamount. Underway bathymetric data will be used to refine dredge targets. 

2) Collect sediment cores across a depth transect to enable work investigating paleo-oceanographic conditions using proxies. Preferably at least a multicore proximal to IODP site 1172, and piston cores at the mid- and shallow-depth sites.

3) Collect high resolution swath bathymetry and sub-bottom profile data to see how far recent sediment flows extend from the Cascade Seamount towards IODP site 1172, to test the hypothesis that downslope transport resulted in the observed sediment patterns in core 1172. Existing coverage and resolution of bathymetry across the East Tasman Plateau is insufficient to resolve this question. 

4) CTD to complement the sediment core data if possible. Alternative is for clean underway surface supply samples to be taken where CTD not possible.

This is an extract from the Voyage Objectives in the Voyage Plan.

We plan 4-6 dredges on the Fairway Ridge and Sandy Island area. The specific locations of potential dredge sites are shown on the voyage plan image and are tied to a confidential seismic reflection profile and/or swath bathymetry data. As we have access to high-resolution swath data from the area from the Geological Survey of New Caledonia, there is no necessity to plan a detailed swath survey for each dredge site.

Swath bathymetry and ocean-bottom profiles (continuous collection)
We will continuously collect bathymetric data and the North Loyalty Basin will be crossed during the transit voyage, thus requiring no additional time to collect this important swath profile.

Gravity (continuous collection)
We will continuously collect gravity data. There is no deviation necessary to obtain gravity measurements over the northwestern part of the Fairway Ridge as we will be crossing this area as part of the dredging component of the survey.

CTD, hydrocast and bio-optical cast
We will take two daily CTD profiles and hydrocast water samples to 500m to characterise the water at time of deployment for pigment, nutrient, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity concentrations (up to 25 stations over the whole voyage). For this we will require the 36-bottle CTD rosette. Additional sensors to be included on the CTD frame include chlorophyll and CDOM fluorometers, absorption and backscattering meter, beam transmissometer, dissolved oxygen, deep SUNA and SeaFET pH. A Satlantic radiometer will be deployed separately at each station to a
depth of 200m. We will be able to provide sensors that are not available through the MNF equipment pool (i.e. Satlantic SeaFET pH, Satlantic radiometer, Wetlabs acs and bb9, Hobilabs Hydroscat-6). Water samples will be filtered or chemically fixed on board according to standard operating procedures. We anticipate each deployment station taking 1.5 hours, with deployments taking place at the same time each morning and afternoon (nominally 0930 and 1400 hours), when not conflicting
with dredge operations.

Robotic Profiling Floats and bio-optics
CSIRO will provide floats equipped with CTD and bio-optical sensors to measure a range of parameters: T, S, dissolved oxygen, chl and CDOM fluorescence, backscattering (4 wavelengths), beam attenuation, upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance (4 wavelengths). Floats will be deployed at stations within Australian waters along the ship's route of transit (estimate 155E and 160E). Deployment of the floats can be undertaken from the A-frame off the rear deck or by two people using a rope and manhandling the float over the stern. Once deployed, the floats will descend to depth and start their pre-programmed cycle of profiling and data collection, with data transmitted via Iridium satellites. During each deployment we will also take a CTD profile and water samples to 1000m to characterise the water at time of deployment for pigment, nutrient, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity concentrations. Additional sensors to be included on the CTD include chlorophyll and CDOM fluorometers, backscattering meter and/or beam transmissometer, dissolved oxygen, deep SUNA and possibly SeaFET pH. We will seek to provide sensors that are not available through the MNF equipment pool (e.g. pH). Water samples will be filtered or chemically fixed on board according to standard operating procedures. We anticipate each deployment station taking 2-4 hours. Additional CTD and bio-optical casts will be taken twice per day (morning and afternoon, nominally 9.30am and 2pm) for bio-optical and biogeochemical sampling around the time of satellite overpasses.

The project aims to discover how and why the Southern Ocean is changing, and to identify the consequences of those changes for climate, sea level and marine life.  The research will help deliver more reliable projections of future climate, from models that more faithfully represent critical Southern Ocean processes; such information is urgently needed to allow Australia to foresee and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.

Clouds over the Southern Ocean are one of the largest uncertainties in the prediction of the future climate of the Southern Hemisphere. This study will bridge an observational gap in this data-sparse, unique region of the World assisting in understanding why climate models poorly simulate the energy balance over the Southern Ocean and improving skill of weather forecast models to simulate frontal cloud systems.

These results contribute to forward projections of anthropogenic climate warming, inform the setting of emissions targets, illuminate controls on climate variability, and provide a baseline for impacts on ocean pelagic ecology.  Sensor data is returned live to the internet and samples are returned annually for further study in shore laboratories.

The Southern Ocean straddles the waters between Australia and Antarctica and has two distinct regions – the subantarctic and the polar seas.   The latter is comprehensively studied by expeditions by Australia’s Antarctic Division, whereas the subantarctic has received much less attention.  This voyage aims to determine processes within the subantarctic environment that control productivity, foodwebs and cycles of elements such as carbon.  Enhanced understanding will maximise investments, such as in ocean time-series in subpolar waters and enable better predictions to be made on how marine life and chemistry are controlled by both natural and human-made shifts in climate and ocean conditions.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): Voyage objectives
The main objective of this transit voyage is to move the vessel from Hobart to Sydney prior to IN2016_V04. The objectives listed below are complementary with the transit.

1. Natural iron fertilisation of the oceans around Australia: linking terrestrial dust and bushfires to marine biogeochemistry
Oceans play a vital role in Earth's climate through the control of atmospheric CO2. An important component of this system is the iron cycle, in which iron-rich aerosols are transported from land via atmosphere to ocean. Iron is a key micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, the scarcity of which controls essential biogeochemical processes. This project will facilitate an integrated ship-based atmospheric observational program for trace elements in oceans around Australia. During the voyages, we will sample and conduct experiments on atmospheric particles containing terrestrial dust, bushfire smoke and anthropogenic emissions that are transported from Australia to its surrounding oceans. This will provide the critical information on atmospheric iron supply for ocean fertility and health, providing the science for predicting a key factor in the future impact of the oceans on climate. The project supports the training and research of two postgraduate PhD students from IMAS-UTAS.

2. We will also opportunistically collect event-based clean rainwater samples using either a polyethylene funnel and collection bottle (when conditions allow) or a Dual Chimney Precipitation Sampler (N-Con Systems model 00-127; currently on order), to quantify the trace metal deposition in the 'bulk' and 'precipitate-only' fractions. Ideally samples would be collected on upper and forward decks, either above the bridge or at the bow when heading into the wind.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v04, titled "Influence of temperature and nutrient supply on the biogeochemical function and diversity of ocean microbes."

Scientific Objectives:
1. Characterise the diversity and function of microbial communities in the relatively warm EAC, against the relatively cool water of the Tasman Sea and adjacent shelf waters.
2. Conduct perturbation experiments to experimentally test the role of temperature and nutrients (particularly N and Fe) in microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations.
3. Assess the links between microbial biomass, size structure and carbon production with higher trophic levels  zooplankton, micronekton and cetaceansseabirds) in a frontal eddy(ies) relative to adjacent shelf and EAC waters.
4. Sample sediments to examine water-sediment geochemical processes and historical record of plankton.

Previous sampling opportunities have not allowed us to revisit water masses (Aim 1) or conduct replicate experiments in the same water mass (Aim 2). Our objectives are therefore to more comprehensively sample the distribution and diversity of microbes across multiple oceanographic features. This includes cross-shelf transects, but also includes cross-eddy transects by extending shelf transects offshore (Aim 3).

To achieve Aim 3, we will require real-time satellite information to identify our target area, as well as access to the IMOS ocean colour, SST, SSH data archive while on board. We will also conduct in situ 'mapping' of the target frontal eddy area using the Triaxus towed underwater body before we determine the exact location of transects and daytime CTD stations. Aim 3 activities will also involve bioacoustic monitoring in the western Tasman Front off Port Stephens, and within and outside of a frontal eddy. This will involve recording data from the EK60 of all 5 frequencies (if possible), which need to be appropriately coordinated with both ADCP. We suggest the two instruments should be programmed to ping and listen together, and to ignore any EK60 deeper than 750 to 1,000 m (to be confirmed with MNF and CSIRO bioacoustics group).

Aims 1 and 2 relate to our original application for ship time and are hence the top priority. The Aim 3 activities occur mostly at night, which can be integrated into the day-time focussed sampling of Aims 1 and 2. Our intent is therefore to address these aims in waters north of Bass Strait (depending on the oceanographic features present).

Activities to address Aim 4 have the lowest priority and are left to later in the voyage, but PIs have indicated that sediment cores from Port Hacking (NSW) will have strong scientific value for examining sediment fluxes and looking at the historic presence of microbial taxa.

Voyage objectives:
SOTS
The primary objective is to first deploy a reduced set (SAZ and FluxPulse) and then recover a full set of SOTS moorings (SOFS, Pulse, and SAZ). Additional work will obtain ancillary information on the atmospheric and oceanographic conditions using CTD casts, underway measurements, the Triaxus towed body, and autonomous profiling "Bio-Argo" floats. Each of the SOTS moorings delivers to specific aspects of the atmosphere-ocean exchanges, with some redundancy: 
* the SAZ sediment trap mooring focuses on quantifying the transfer of carbon and other nutrients to the ocean interior by sinking particles, and collecting samples to investigate their ecological controls
* the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) focuses on air properties, ocean stratification, waves, and currents.
* the Pulse biogeochemistry mooring focuses on processes important to biological CO2 consumption, including net community production from oxygen measurements and nitrate depletion, biomass concentrations from bio-optics and bio-acoustics, and collection of water samples for nutrient and plankton quantification.
* the FluxPulse mooring combines some elements of Pulse onto the SOFS platform to create a combined mooring, which will be deployed for the first time in 2016. This combination meets financial constraints while still measuring almost all planned parameters
CAPRICORN
* The primary objective is to collect cloud, aerosol, precipitation, radiation and atmospheric composition measurements over the Southern Ocean over 30 days, and to capture the latitudinal variability of these properties from the latitude of Hobart down to 55-60S if time allows. The Investigator will be equipped with a state-of the art suite of instruments for that purpose (see list in voyage plan).
* In order to address the "satellite validation" objectives, we need to locate the research vessel under the track of the CloudSat-CALIPSO instrument and within the larger swath of the NASA GPM and A-Train radars and radiometers. This will be achieved in coordination with the requirement to sample a mesoscale oceanic eddy using a dedicated pattern that will include satellite track following and mesoscale eddy sampling using radial transects, after the SOTS moorings are deployed and recovered.
* In order to address the "ACCESS model validation" objectives, we need to sample the sub-grid scale variability of the atmospheric properties, therefore we will undertake some periods of intensive sampling of 12*12 km2 grids with small-scale lawnmower patterns, ensuring that the aerosol measurements are not perturbed by the ship exhaust. The timing and location of these grids will be determined during the voyage.
Eddy
* Deploy a suite of floats, two different models per eddy, to obtain profiles of temperature, salinity, velocity, oxygen, nitrate, pH and bio-optics near the eddy centre while we perform spatial surveys.
* Measure the velocities and mixing in the two eddies.
* Quantify the elemental fluxes associated with the eddy circulation, including nutrient transport and air-sea CO2 flux.
* Measure the biological response to the circulation and nutrient transport, including primary productivity, trace metal biogeochemistry, new production and the respiration of downward carbon flux (using free-drifting sediment traps).
Our combined ship-satellite-float observations will provide the most comprehensive view thus far of Southern Ocean eddies. Our work also contributes to emerging international programs in the Southern Ocean that are combining expanded autonomous observations with large scale modelling efforts. Full details are in the in2016_v02 voyage plan.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v05, titled "The Great Barrier Reef as a significant source of climatically relevant aerosol particles."

Voyage objectives
The main objective of the voyage is to acquire observations that will address four key science questions about the role of atmospheric composition in the GBR region:
1. Do marine aerosols along the north Queensland coast have a significant signature that is coral derived?
2. How does this aerosol change its physicochemical properties, especially its capacity to act as CCN, as winds carry it from the reefs to the north Queensland rainforests?
3. What is the significance of this ecosystem as a source of aerosol particles and will potential degradation of the reef cause significant variations in particle number being generated over the reef.
4. Should changes in this aerosol, associated with reef degradation, be taken into account when modelling the radiative climate and rainfall?

* Two stations on the western side of the GBR. These stations will enable us to sample the air masses that have traversed over the reefs and have been enriched by the emissions from the reefs. 

* One station on the eastern side of the GBR. As the predominant wind direction during the trade wind season is south easterlies this station will enable us to characterise the remote pacific air masses coming towards the GBR.

* Optics station in deep water (&gt;200m) east of Heron Island to characterise the sea surface spectral reflectance and in water optical properties including the spectral absorption of optically active constituents in the water.

Supplementary Project: Biogeochemical and optical properties of the Coral Sea and Queensland Shelf
Objectives
1. To collect high resolution biogeochemical observations for validation of the 4km and 1km near real time eReefs models (https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/)
2. To get modellers in the field to better understand methods and issues associated with modern methods of data collection
3. To collect in situ optical data for the NASA CORAL project which is operating a very high resolution airborne hyperspectral sensor along selected transects in the GBR.

Piggy-back Project: Project 3DGBR - Multibeam bathymetry mapping of the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea
Objectives:
1. To acquire high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and water column data along the voyage track for the duration of the voyage. The new bathymetry data will be used to improve the accuracy of the 100 m-resolution DEM for the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea, called the 'gbr100' grid: http://www.deepreef.org/bathymetry/65-3dgbr-bathy.html
2. On an opportunity basis and subject to workload, acquire sub-bottom profile data using the SBP120 profiler during the voyage. The sub-bottom profiler data will be used in conjunction with the multibeam data for ongoing marine geoscience projects in the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v03. Titled Monitoring Ocean Change and Variability along 170oW from the ice edge to the equator This voyage involves two legs from Hobart to Wellington(NZ) and Wellington(NZ) to Lautoka(Fiji). Voyage objectives of the major project - Monitoring Ocean Change and Variability along 170oW from the ice edge to the equator  are:
The primary voyage objective is to obtain repeat occupations of the 155 full-depth CTD and Niskin casts along the GO-SHIP P15S section, with chemistry performed on water collected at 36 bottle levels.  We will measure temperature, salinity, pressure, oxygen, fluorometry, shear and micro-scale temperature continuously, and the major nutrients, oxygen, salinity, CFC and carbon components discretely via chemical analysis on board. Small amounts of material will be filtered and stored for genomic analyses back on land. CSIRO has completed this line twice before and international groups have completed similar work along lines further east. The work plan and timings are based on these past voyages.

Argo float deployments will also be carried out - usually when just leaving a CTD station (SOCCOM floats) or during transit (we may slow the ship speed slightly). These will be over the ship's stern (preferred).
Voyage objectives of the supplementary project -Facing the challenges of under-ice for autonomous navigation are:
Accurate navigation under both drift and stationary ice is one of the key unanswered questions in polar marine science and engineering. The primary aims of this project are to (1) estimate INS drift and calibration times; and, (2) test the integration of acoustic positioning methods in an INS within a drifting and rotating frame of reference. This project will develop error propagation models at increasing latitudes and test the use of a non-stationary, ship borne acoustic positioning network on a small (&lt;3 m) AUV. Both are critical for robust, accurate and reliable AUV operation under-ice.  

The primary voyage objective is make measurements of inertial drift during vessel transit and calibration time while the Investigator is on station across as broad a range of latitudes as possible. The way that this will be achieved is that, while the vessel is on station, bench top tests will be conducted for alignment. Then, while moving, tests of inertial drift will be conducted. The student on board will work with the other PIs on board to coordinate timings of these tests but will not disrupt the other work taking place on board. The work plan and timing is based on methodologies established during past voyages. Full details can be found in the in2016_v03 voyage plan. Previous MNF voyages include RV Franklin FR 05/2001 and RV Southern Surveyor SS200901. </skos:definition>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v06, titled "Sustained monitoring of the EAC: mass, heat and freshwater transports."

This voyage will recover and re-deploy an array of six full-depth current meter and property (temperature, salinity and pressure) moorings from the continental slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (27o S). The observing system is designed to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC. In order to resolve interannual and decadal signals we aim to maintain a multi-year deployment of the array.

The following specific objectives will be performed:
1. Recover and deploy moorings at appropriate locations.
2. Complete CTD/rosette stations at each mooring location, with LADCP.
3. Complete a number of Ship ADCP sections along the mooring line.

Supplementary projects:

1) Turbulence scales and horizontal variability in the surface layer of the Ocean.

Objectives:
To gain more insight into turbulence scales in the upper ocean (0 - 200 m depth) across the continental shelf using a TuboMAP turbulence probe and to measure horizontal variability of CTD data in the upper ocean using a Seabird 19+ CTD unit. The TurboMAP can record data with vertical profiling (upcast and downcast). Based on a temperature gradient and mean falling speed of the probe the levels of turbulence dissipation and mixing properties can be derived.

The CTD (Seabird 19+) unit will collect data at a fixed depth (ca. 20 m) while the ship is drifting at a speed of 0.5 - 1 m/s.

2) Spatial and temporal variability in the distribution and abundance of seabirds.

Objectives:
The project seeks to quantify the distribution and abundance of seabirds at sea using standardised seabird survey protocols. One or two dedicated observers will collect real-time data on seabirds observed within 300m transect during daylight hours while the vessel is underway. Incidental observations will be collected while the vessel is stationary (eg CTD stations) or while the vessel is deploying moorings.
The data collected will be compatible with previous seabird at sea surveys conducted around Australia and farther south, allowing for analyses and assessments to be extended by the current surveys.

The distribution of seabirds at sea is strongly linked with oceanographic features such as convergences that concentrate prey at densities that allow for efficient foraging by seabirds. Our surveys on the voyage will link with oceanographic investigations to identify the types and strengths of oceanographic features at which we observe different species of seabirds that utilise different methods of feeding (surface seizing, diving etc).

No dedicated ship time is required for the seabird surveys. Surveys are conducted by observers while the vessel is underway during daylight hours.

The planet’s largest current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) distributes heat, freshwater and carbon-dioxide among the major oceans. It is a central element of the global overturning circulation that has allowed the ocean to absorb 93% of global warming. Despite Southern Ocean winds increasing for the last 2 decades, the ACC strength has not changed. A major puzzle in understanding climate variability is how the ACC responds to the additional wind energy. We will address the societally-important need to understand how the ACC and Southern Ocean’s capacity to absorb heat and carbon-dioxide will respond to climate variability and change.

We will combine a full-depth CTD/LADCP and bathymetric survey of the full meander, with targeted, rapid underway sampling of smaller-scale variability using the Triaxus towed CTD, a VMP-2000 microstructure profiler and underway instruments. Multi-beam data will be important for interpreting the survey data. Water samples will be analysed for nutrients, chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon (POC). Incubation experiments will be conducted to observe phytoplankton productivity under varying physical and chemical conditions.
Objectives
1. Deployment of a fleet of EM-APEX profiling floats.
2. Deployment of a tall mooring at the crest of a meander in the Polar Front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.
3. Full-depth hydrographic survey of the physics and biogeochemistry of the targeted ACC meander, conducting transects across the front. This will include CTD/LADCP profiles, water sample analysis, VMP-2000 microstructure profiles, bathymetry and underway

Australia has protected spectacular deep-sea coral reefs living on undersea mountains (‘seamounts’) by including some in marine reserves off Tasmania. This protection is an important step in marine conservation because deep-sea coral reefs support highly diverse communities of seafloor organisms, but are fragile and vulnerable to human disturbance – particularly by bottom trawling.

Scientists on RV Investigator will conduct camera surveys to map the extent of the globally-significant deep-sea coral reefs, and determine how much of the reef area lies within reserves. Scientists will also measure how the reefs have recovered from earlier trawling impacts since being protected in marine reserves.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): Integrated Marine Observing System: monitoring of East Australian Current property transports at 27 degrees South (Chief Scientist:  Dr Bernadette Sloyan, CSIRO)

The East Australian Current (EAC) is the complex and highly energetic western boundary current of the South Pacific Ocean.  The EAC is the dominant mechanism for the redistribution of heat and freshwater between the ocean and atmosphere in the Australian region; it is a vital component of the eastern Australian coastal ecosystem. The monitoring of the EAC is central to our understanding of how climate variability is communicated through the global ocean. This ocean current time-series will provide significant insights into the interactions between the EAC, the Pacific basin and the local shelf ocean circulation.

The overall scientific objective is to obtain frequent measurements of surface and deep ocean properties that control the transfer of CO2  from the atmosphere to the upper ocean, and then onwards to the ocean interior in the form of sinking particles. This "biological pump" drives carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and writes the sedimentary record.  The controls on its intensity
are complex and involve processes that vary on daily, weekly, seasonal, and interannual timescales. Obtaining observations with the necessary frequency is not possible from ships.  For this reason the NCRIS IMOS Southern Ocean Time Series Facility seeks to obtain this information using automated sensor measurements and sample collections.

This voyage will recover the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS-1) mooring to obtain in-air and in-sea measurements to better understand the exchange of heat, moisture, and gases between the ocean and atmosphere.  It will also recover the Pulse-7 mooring that has been making measurements of temperature, salinity, mixed layer depth, photosynthetically available radiation, oxygen, total dissolved gases, and phytoplankton fluorescence and backscatter.  The
Pulse-7 mooring also collects 24 paired water samples, approximately weekly, for later measurement of dissolved nitrate, silicate, inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity.</skos:definition>

Scientific Objectives
"Next Wave" is a new programme of the National Facility Research Vessel Southern Surveyor to encourage young scientists to try research at sea, inspired by the success of the 2006 voyage led by Dr Moninya Roughan and supported by ARCNESS. Next Wave provides the additional crew as well as a full scientific staff (electronics, hydro, computing etc) on their transit voyages between ports. SIMS has hosted two recent transit voyages Transit SS03-2008 (Aug08, Gladstone to Sydney) and Transit SS01-2009 (Jan09, Sydney to Wellington), with students from all over Australia. The students and leaders work 12 h shifts between 07:00-23:00 to operate the CTD rosette and N70, XBT casts, a well as underway TSG, fluorometer etc, bird/whale counts, etc.

The Southern Ocean Time Series provides world-leading automated observations from deep-ocean moorings of the exchanges of heat, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen between the ocean and atmosphere, and the physical and biological processes that control them. These results contribute to forward projections of anthropogenic climate warming, inform the setting of emissions targets, illuminate controls on climate variability, and provide a baseline for impacts on ocean pelagic ecology.  Sensor data is returned live to the internet and samples are returned annually for further study in shore laboratories.

Surface and subsurface subantarctic Biogeochemistry of Carbon and Iron, Southern Ocean Time Series site (Lead Principal Investigator: Prof Philip Boyd, UTAS)
The Southern Ocean straddles the waters between Australia and Antarctica and has two distinct regions – the subantarctic and the polar seas. The latter is comprehensively studied by expeditions by Australia’s Antarctic Division, whereas the subantarctic has received much less attention. This voyage aims to determine processes within the subantarctic environment that control productivity, foodwebs and cycles of elements such as carbon. Enhanced understanding will maximise investments, such as in ocean time-series in subpolar waters, and enable better predictions to be made on how marine life and chemistry are controlled by both natural and human-made shifts in climate and ocean conditions.

Scientific Objectives:
The East Australian Current (EAC) is a complex and highly energetic western boundary system in
the south-western Pacific off eastern Australia. It provides both the western boundary of the South
Pacific gyre and the linking element between the Pacific and Indian Ocean gyres. This voyage will
retrieve an array of full-depth current meter and property (CTD) moorings from the continental
slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (26oS). At this location the EAC, north of the high eddy
variability, the approaching its maximum strength and its flow is relatively uniform and coherent.
The aim of this observing system is to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC.
This a component of IMOS, and will provide an intensive reference set of measurements of the
EAC flow over sustained period for monitoring EAC transport, improved understanding of
relationship of EAC and the South Pacific gyre and impact of the coastal marine ecosystem, and
validation and interpretation of the current system in numerous climate and ocean models. The
mooring array is located on the existing long-term XBT transects, satellite altimetry and glider
tracks. The EAC deep mooring array has been complemented by a Queensland- IMOS operated
inshore mooring array on the continental shelf region.</skos:definition>

slope to the abyssal waters off Brisbane (26oS). At this location the EAC, north of the high eddy
variability, the approaching its maximum strength and its flow is relatively uniform and coherent.
The aim of this observing system is to capture the mean and time-varying flow of the EAC.
This a component of IMOS, and will provide an intensive reference set of measurements of the
EAC flow over sustained period for monitoring EAC transport, improved understanding of
relationship of EAC and the South Pacific gyre and impact of the coastal marine ecosystem, and
validation and interpretation of the current system in numerous climate and ocean models. The
mooring array is located on the existing long-term XBT transects, satellite altimetry and glider
tracks. The EAC deep mooring array has been complemented by a Queensland- IMOS operated
inshore mooring array on the continental shelf region.</skos:scopeNote>

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2020_v01 is titled “Development of William’s Ridge, Kerguelen Plateau: tectonics, hotspot magmatism, microcontinents, and Australia’s Extended Continental Shelf.” 

The Indian Ocean contains numerous enigmatic topographic features, and some of the least understood are submarine ridges. This expedition will focus on William’s Ridge, part of Earth’s second largest submarine plateau, the Kerguelen Plateau, and on the once adjoining Broken Ridge. The voyage will acquire and analyse rock samples and geophysical data from these ridges to understand how they formed and evolved. The research will aim to resolve questions about the plate tectonics of the Indian Ocean, determine if William’s Ridge is a continental sliver, help understand massive volcanism triggered by mantle hotspots, and potentially contribute to expanding Australia’s sovereign undersea territory.

The two principle scientific objectives of the voyage are: 
1. To gain important new knowledge of the rifting, breakup, and initial separation of tectonic plates. The project constitutes the first-ever case study of conjugate oceanic plateau end-members – the formerly contiguous and subaerial, but now separated and submarine Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge in the southern Indian Ocean – to investigate these phenomena.
2. To acquire, analyse, and interpret data and samples necessary for Australia to make a new or revised submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). The purpose is to extend our marine jurisdiction to include William’s Ridge, an extension of the Central Kerguelen Plateau, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 

To address the scientific objectives of the project, the voyage objectives encompass acquiring and initially processing multibeam bathymetry/backscatter, water-column echo-sounding, sub-bottom profile, seismic reflection, deep-towed camera, gravity, and magnetic data acquisition; and acquiring rock samples by dredging. The acoustic data will be used to determine the locations of the seismic reflection profiles, and the acoustic and seismic data will be used to determine locations of dredging sites. The following activities will be undertaken: 

1a. Multibeam bathymetry/backscatter: we will acquire multibeam data along William’s Ridge, the conjugate portion of Broken Ridge not covered by the MH370 search data, and associated seafloor topographic features. 
1b. Sub-bottom profiling: we will acquire SBP120 data continuously multibeam data acquisition. 
1c. Seismic reflection: we will utilise the MNF’s new seismic system, currently consisting of a 40-channel, 500-m-long, 12.5-m group spacing streamer and two GI airguns.
1d. Dredging: recovery of continental, hotspot-related, and/or oceanic rocks forming the basement of William’s Ridge and associated topographic features in the Labuan Basin, in multiple locations, is the goal, complemented by sampling the conjugate basement of Broken Ridge. 
2a. Single-beam and multi-beam water column echo-sounding: we will collect EK60 and ME70 data throughout the entire voyage.  
2b. Deep tow camera: on the basis of dredges and water column echo-sounding data, we will acquire still and video photography at locations characterized by mixed hotspot-related/oceanic/continental rocks and acoustic plumes emanating from the seafloor. 
3a. Gravity: gravity data will be acquired by the shipboard gravity meter during the entire voyage. No modern shipboard gravity data have been acquired over William’s Ridge. 
3b. Magnetics: we will acquire total magnetic field data using the towed proton precession magnetometer on the transits and throughout multibeam/sub-bottom profiling data acquisition.

3b. Magnetics: we will acquire total magnetic field data using the towed proton precession magnetometer on the transits and throughout multibeam/sub-bottom profiling data acquisition.

This includes teleseismic receiver function analysis, teleseismic and ambient noise tomography, joint inversion of receiver functions and ambient noise dispersion, shear wave splitting analysis, autocorrelation analysis, and enhancing of regional and teleseismic wavefield through array seismology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the structural, thermal, and compositional nature of the central MRC by applying a range of seismic imaging techniques to identify velocity anomalies in the crust and mantle.

These seismological objectives will be addressed by PIs Tkalcic, Eakin, and Rawlinson following instrument and data recovery scheduled by the MNF in 2021.
To achieve the above objectives, we will deploy ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) around Macquarie Island, to be recovered in 2021.
The primary marine geophysical objectives of the voyage are to:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define sites for OBS deployments in the vicinity of Macquarie Island using multibeam sonar and sub-bottom profiling data. Pending scheduled testing later this year, deployment parameters are tentatively in water depths =1000 m and on gentle seafloor slopes, ideally flat, but not to exceed 30°. Sediment cover is preferred over bare igneous rock for OBS deployment. Existing data around Macquarie Island are not of sufficient quality to define deployment sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characterise the neotectonics, structure, and stratigraphy of the active Australian-Pacific plate boundary in the vicinity of Macquarie Island using multibeam sonar (both bathymetry and backscatter), sub-bottom profiling, gravity, and magnetics data.

Objective 1. Collect seafloor and subseafloor geophysical data. This data will be used:
a. To identify seafloor fabric, which will help refine plate reconstructions of the Tasman Seas in areas difficult to constrain from magnetic anomaly lineations alone;
b. To obtain comprehensive multibeam and backscatter coverage of the seamounts and their morphology to understand tectonic setting, eruptive style, palaeo-water-depth and sedimentation patterns;
c. To assist in dredge site targeting by identifying sediment-free scarps and slopes;
d. Sub-bottom profile data will be collected to provide additional context for the nature of the near-surface sediment and geological structure.
Objective 2. Dredge volcanic samples from seamounts along the proposed Balleny Seamount chain.
Ashore, samples will be:
a. Ar/Ar Dated to determine the age and duration of seamount formation;
b. Volcanic coherent rocks will be described macroscopically, petrographically and mineralogically to classify and characterise the type volcanism on the seamounts. Comparing the nature and origin of volcanism at different sites may reveal multiple episodes of
volcanism or variations in volcanic activity in time and space.
c. Volcaniclastic rocks will be described macroscopically, petrographically, mineralogically and include ash morphology descriptions. This work will constrain submarine/subaerial eruption/emplacement and style of transport
d. Sedimentary rocks will be described macroscopically, microscopically and petrographically.
Additional U-Pb geochronology will be undertaken as will micro- and macro-fossil palaeontology. These analyses can constrain depth, environment, and time of deposition, important for constraining the timing and rate of subsidence.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): RV Investigator research voyage in2019_v03, titled “A coupled bio-physical, ecosystem-scale, examination of Australia’s International Indian Ocean Expedition line.”
The voyage will take place in the SE Indian Ocean along 110°E between 39°30’S and 11°30’S and, to meet the scientific objectives, a wide range of activities will be conducted. Essentially, on station activities can be classified into CTD deployments with associated water sampling, zooplankton sampling with a range of nets and profiling for optical properties and radiometry (Table 2). Several laboratory and on-deck incubation activities will be conducted and deployment of a Continuous Plankton Recorder, micro-zooplankton profiler, Vertical Microstructure Profiler VMP200, ARGO floats, surface drifters and sonobuoys will also take place. The Triaxus with instrumentation will be towed on the return leg back to Fremantle.
CTD sampling and the vertical hauls with an Indian Ocean Standard Net (IOSN) are the priority tasks at all stations. After this, in the day time, the optical properties work will be a priority and, at night, plankton sampling with the various nets is the priority.
When we were preparing this voyage plan it became apparent that the in-water optics deployments (PI Antoine; objective 4) would take much longer than originally expected. This would result in a considerable reduction of time available to transit between stations so much so that we would not be able to maintain the two stations per day that were done in the original 1960’s 110°E voyages. We subsequently prepared a revised voyage plan and each of the 20 stations on the 110°E line is now occupied for around 16 hours instead of 4 hours.
For this voyage, on each station we now plan to complete a morning deep CTD (water for Thompson, Antoine, Ostrowski and Seymour teams) and vertical zooplankton haul with the Indian Ocean Standard Net. This will be followed by the optics measurements in the early afternoon and, in the evening, an EZ net tow, assorted plankton and neuston tows and a shallow CTD to obtain water for experiments and incubations (Raes and Landry). As there will be some time available in the afternoon after the optics measurements, we plan to conduct additional day-time EZ net and plankton tows, vertical microstructure profiling and other sampling that would benefit from day/night comparisons. The final temporal arrangement of these late afternoon activities will be subject to time availability, sea conditions and might change to maximize efficiency. However, the evening surface neuston tows must start promptly at 18:00.
This revised plan has no difference from the original voyage proposal with respect to distance travelled by the ship. If we encounter bad weather along the 110°E line, we could wait until it clears using the two-day contingency period. However, if bad weather occurs at the southern-most stations along the 110°E line, the long-term marine weather forecast would have to be considered, as it may be wiser to proceed northwards and skip a station.</skos:definition>

      <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Research Voyage: FR 03/2001: Franklin: The aim of the study is to increase our knowledge of what happened to the region geologically over the last 100 million years, with special emphasis on sedimentation and oceanographic changes during 1) Cretaceous rifting, and 2) Gondwanan drifting apart in the Cretaceous and Cainozoic.&lt;BR&gt;
The four major activities are designed to fill important gaps in the geoscience knowledge of southeastern Australia by:&lt;BR&gt;
a) helping to characterise the pre-breakup Late Jurassic and Cretaceous strata (160-65 million years ago)

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): “RV Investigator research voyage in2016_v04, titled “Constraining external iron inputs and cycling in the southern extension of the East Australian Current.”

The primary objective of the voyage is to characterise the sources and biogeochemical cycling of iron and associated nutrients and their impact on productivity southwest, southeast and northeast of Tasmania. This will require various deployments at a number of process and transit stations.

Mesoscale and sub-mesoscale physics and biogeochemistry
TRIAXUS: This will provide high-resolution real-time data acquisition on upper ocean (1-200 m)
physics (mixed layer depth) and biology (chlorophyll fluorescence, transmissivity). We will survey
each process station by conducting a transect across each station, ‘figure-eight’ type survey if
possible for 10-12 hours, and tow the Triaxus between process stations 1, 2 and 3. These datasets
will be complemented by those from underway sampling (including nutrient concentrations, biooptics,
Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRF, a measure of phytoplankton ‘health’), trace metal
concentrations using a trace-metal clean tow-fish to sample at 5 m.
SADCP/LADCP: Continuous measurements of velocity will be collected along the ships track using
the 75 kHz and 150 kHz shipboard ADCPs. A lowered ADCP (LADCP) will collect horizontal velocity
measurements at each station from the CTD package.

Process and transit station deployments determine iron supply and cycling
CTD rosette: Profiles of temperature, salinity, and oxygen through the upper ocean at transit stations and full ocean depth at process stations. Water samples collected with the 36-bottle rosette will be analysed on board for salinity, oxygen, nutrients. LADCP data will also be collected from the CTD deployments.
TMR and ISP deployments: An autonomous 12 bottle trace metal-clean rosette (TMR) system and 6 in situ pumps (ISPs) will be used to collect trace element and isotope samples in dissolved and particulate phases. Clean sampling and analytical container laboratories will allow for shipboard processing, experiments and some near real-time analyses of iron at sea. The majority of the analyses will take place ashore after the voyage using sophisticated instrumentation not suited for shipboard use.
In situ primary production: Primary production experiments will be conducted at each process station. The experiments will require radiolabeling samples with 55Fe and 14C in the Radiation van and then incubated in the deck-board incubators.
Incubations: Some incubations may be conducted at each process station. The experiments will require the changes in light, nutrient and or trace metal conditions. Samples will then be incubated in the deck-board incubators or the ones in the dry lab.
Multicorer deployment: Surface sediment cores (0 to 30 cm) will be collected on and off the Tasmanian shelf and at the three process stations. Cores will be evaluated for integrity upon recovery, sectioned inside a nitrogen-filled glove bag, and centrifuged to extract pore fluid for trace metal and rare-earth analysis.
Kasten gravity corer: Longer sediment cores (0 to 4 m) will be collected at the three process stations. Cores will be evaluated for integrity upon recovery and subsampled for shore-based analyse. These will complement multicorer deployments. We hope to obtain one core at each of the process stations. Core barrels will 4 m in length.

physics (mixed layer depth) and biology (chlorophyll fluorescence, transmissivity). We will survey
each process station by conducting a transect across each station, ‘figure-eight’ type survey if
possible for 10-12 hours, and tow the Triaxus between process stations 1, 2 and 3. These datasets
will be complemented by those from underway sampling (including nutrient concentrations, biooptics,
Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRF, a measure of phytoplankton ‘health’), trace metal
concentrations using a trace-metal clean tow-fish to sample at 5 m.
SADCP/LADCP: Continuous measurements of velocity will be collected along the ships track using
the 75 kHz and 150 kHz shipboard ADCPs. A lowered ADCP (LADCP) will collect horizontal velocity
measurements at each station from the CTD package.

Process and transit station deployments determine iron supply and cycling
CTD rosette: Profiles of temperature, salinity, and oxygen through the upper ocean at transit stations and full ocean depth at process stations. Water samples collected with the 36-bottle rosette will be analysed on board for salinity, oxygen, nutrients. LADCP data will also be collected from the CTD deployments.
TMR and ISP deployments: An autonomous 12 bottle trace metal-clean rosette (TMR) system and 6 in situ pumps (ISPs) will be used to collect trace element and isotope samples in dissolved and particulate phases. Clean sampling and analytical container laboratories will allow for shipboard processing, experiments and some near real-time analyses of iron at sea. The majority of the analyses will take place ashore after the voyage using sophisticated instrumentation not suited for shipboard use.
In situ primary production: Primary production experiments will be conducted at each process station. The experiments will require radiolabeling samples with 55Fe and 14C in the Radiation van and then incubated in the deck-board incubators.
Incubations: Some incubations may be conducted at each process station. The experiments will require the changes in light, nutrient and or trace metal conditions. Samples will then be incubated in the deck-board incubators or the ones in the dry lab.
Multicorer deployment: Surface sediment cores (0 to 30 cm) will be collected on and off the Tasmanian shelf and at the three process stations. Cores will be evaluated for integrity upon recovery, sectioned inside a nitrogen-filled glove bag, and centrifuged to extract pore fluid for trace metal and rare-earth analysis.
Kasten gravity corer: Longer sediment cores (0 to 4 m) will be collected at the three process stations. Cores will be evaluated for integrity upon recovery and subsampled for shore-based analyse. These will complement multicorer deployments. We hope to obtain one core at each of the process stations. Core barrels will 4 m in length.

      <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Investigator (RV): Project HALO will conduct detailed survey operations at four sites with Halimeda bioherms on the northern GBR shelf and the directly adjacent, deeper offshore areas (Fig. 1, 2).  The offshore work will be conducted first in transit to the most northern site adjacent to Wreck Bay, off Cape Grenville. The shelf work aims to conduct dense grids of geophysical lines at the four bioherm sites, representing the variety of morphological sub-types, and spread between the Ribbon Reefs and Cape Grenville study areas (Fig. 3-6). We plan to spend ~4-5 days at each shelf grid site, roughly divided into 1 day each for geophysical mapping, AUV and ROV ops, sea water and seabed sampling. The transits between the shelf sites, are also important to investigate additional Halimeda bioherm areas, paleo-channels, inter-reef passages and the connections to the upper-slope and canyons where ever possible. The following instruments and methods will be applied during the voyage to provide data for the scientific objectives:
1) Bioherm surface and subsurface geomorphology (geophysical surveys) 
2) Bioherm internal structure and composition (sediment coring and rock sampling) 
3) Bioherm modern habitats and biota (seabed imaging, seabed sampling and water sampling)
4) Deeper undersea landscape (slope, submarine canyons and basin) and key oceanographic processes (multibeam mapping, sediment coring and water sampling)
5) The role of Halimeda algal habitat in tropical marine carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling

Upwelling will occur within canyons that are exposed to westward slope currents and be largest where ware core eddies are found. Two canyon systems that periodically exhibit upwelling will be surveyed during the voyage. an unnamed canyon system off the Bonney Coast is our principal area of interest, and will be surveyed first, but if time permits, a second canyon system, off the southeast tip of Kangaroo Island, will also be surveyed. The first two weeks in February is generally a period of coastal upwelling so it is also likely that such an event will be captured during the cruise but this is not essential to the canyon study. A broad-scale mapping survey suing swath, acoustics and ADCP will be conducted at each target area to obtain high-resolution bathymetry and a synoptic picture of the canyon and coastal upwelling. Following the mapping a series of transects along and to each side of the canyon axis will be established. Stations occupied along transects will be sampled with a CTD, lowered ADCP, grab, dredge and trawl.&lt;br&gt;

Assessing oceanographic delivery of nutrients to Ningaloo Reef
Part I : Autumn Dynamics
Scientific Objectives
Ningaloo Reef is Australias largest fringing coral reef and the basis of a major tourist industry. Though diverse and delicate, coral reefs (and the controls of their productivity) remain poorly understood. Understanding the interaction of the reef with the surrounding ocean is essential for predicting and managing the impacts of human and climate-induced changes, and therefore for the effective conservation of reefs. This proposal is part of a new initiative aimed at providing a scientific basis for determining the oceanographic distance beyond which industrial developments will not damage a reefs ecological processes. This analysis is essential for maintaining guiding sustainable development in the region. We will determine the seasonal differences in the productivity and delivery of nutrients and particles, by the Leeuwin (LC) and Ningaloo Currents (NC) on the continental shelf off Ningaloo Reef, WA, with special emphasis on identifying coastal upwelling mechanisms driving reef production. This work is part of a 3-year funded ARC project (Waite, Roughan, Pattiaratchi, Kotta) comparing reef-based uptake of nutrients from the surrounding ocean with the shelf oceanography delivering materials to the Ningaloo reef. We have applied for a second voyage in summer 2011/12 to complete the study.

PINTS - primary Productivity induced by Nitrogen and Iron in the Tasman Sea.
Role of iron and other micronutrients in controlling primary productivity in the Tasman Sea: bioavailability, biogeochemical cycling and sources.
Scientific Objectives -Macro- and micronutrients, mainly iron and nitrate, control oceanic primary productivity, phytoplankton community composition and subsequently carbon uptake and generation of radiatively important gases for climate. Assessing key underlying processes that control primary productivity and carbon export to the ocean's interior such as micro and macro-nutrient bioavailability is required to fully understand the ocean role in controlling climate change and improve modelling approaches. Indeed, data allowing an accurate modelling of iron bioavailability in the oceans is sparse. Although large dust deposition from eastern Australia to the ocean may occur, the Tasman Sea presents a region of great contrast: northern waters are nutrient poor while southern waters are nutrient rich, but low in iron. Consequently, the input of iron via dust to the northern and southern regions may influence nutrient uptake, primary production and nitrogen fixation.
The proposed research voyage will study iron bioavailability, sources and its biogeochemical cycling in the surface waters of the Tasman Sea, along with the role of other micronutrients. Our proposed voyage track will provide measurements on the effect of variable sources of iron (Australian continental dust, shelf sediments) on iron biogeochemistry. Results from this voyage will also provide modellers at CMAR with a key dataset to predict the biological control of the oceans on climate. This project will develop new methods for measuring iron bioavailability (e.g. iron dependent bioreporter) and limitation (e.g. photophysiological parameters) in the ocean, with potentially wide application to the growth of Australian and international</skos:definition>

Indeed, data allowing an accurate modelling of iron bioavailability in the oceans is sparse. Although large dust deposition from eastern Australia to the ocean may occur, the Tasman Sea presents a region of great contrast: northern waters are nutrient poor while southern waters are nutrient rich, but low in iron. Consequently, the input of iron via dust to the northern and southern regions may influence nutrient uptake, primary production and nitrogen fixation.
The proposed research voyage will study iron bioavailability, sources and its biogeochemical cycling in the surface waters of the Tasman Sea, along with the role of other micronutrients. Our proposed voyage track will provide measurements on the effect of variable sources of iron (Australian continental dust, shelf sediments) on iron biogeochemistry. Results from this voyage will also provide modellers at CMAR with a key dataset to predict the biological control of the oceans on climate. This project will develop new methods for measuring iron bioavailability (e.g. iron dependent bioreporter) and limitation (e.g. photophysiological parameters) in the ocean, with potentially wide application to the growth of Australian and international</skos:scopeNote>

We will operate south of 60°S, northward of the ice edge, and between 140°E and 175°W. The specific study area/s within these boundaries will be determined by the locations of vocalising Antarctic blue whales, krill and sea-ice. The survey design is therefore adaptive in that sites will be chosen in real-time on the voyage according to available information. At the commencement of the voyage we will head straight to the closest group of vocalising Antarctic blue whales (ABWs) within our operational area. Vocalising ABWs are able to be detected through sonobuoys (see below) hundreds of kilometres away. When whales are found we will undertake a series of activities at that site. We will then commence a series of line transects in the same region and remain within the same area for the rest of the voyage. The study is therefore on a mesoscale and we do not aim to cover our entire operational area.

Scientific Objectives&lt;br&gt;This project will monitor deep ocean changes via Deep Ocean Time Series Sections (DOTSS) which is Australia's contribution to the International Repeat Hydrography and Carbon Program. Specifically we will reoccupy a full depth ocean section in the Pacific along 170oW from 50oS to the equator with the aim to maintain full depth, high precision hydrographic, carbon and tracer measurements along key sections in the oceans surrounding Australia to monitor circulation and biogeochemical changes on multi-decadal timescales. Station spacing along the section will average about 30nm from 50°S to the equator with close spacing over steep topography.&lt;br&gt;
Voyage Objectives&lt;br&gt;The voyage objectives will be met by undertaking full depth CTD and Niskin bottle casts that measure salinity, temperature and pressure continuously and the major nutrients discretely. We will be relying on achieving International standard (WOCE) accuracy in order to measure what might be small but significant changes at depth. Water samples (24 per cast) collected by niskin bottles at discrete depth in the water column, will be analysed on board for the full suite of nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (DIC) and alkalinity. Samples will also be collected for carbon isotope analyses. Through collaboration with the PMEL and the University of Washington we will be able to measure concentrations.In addition to the standard rosette, shipboard ADCP will deliver underway direct estimate of velocity data along the cruise track. At the direction of the Chief Scientist the CTD/Rosette will be reconfigured during the voyage to include the LADCP for full water column velocity profiles.&lt;br&gt;
The SS 1/2009 voyage will be divided into two legs with port call at Nuku'alofa, Tonga.&lt;br&gt;
